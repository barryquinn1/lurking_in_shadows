abstract = {{“Carbon emissions pricing” means that state institutions charge a price      for emissions. By contrast, “carbon shadow pricing” means that the      long-term impacts of emissions are factored into the planning of major      projects even if current market prices do not reflect those impacts yet.      Shadow prices are fictional, but have a very real impact. A high shadow      price for fuel, for example, can make a power plant unviable even though      it may look attractive at current market prices. The climate economist      Hans-Jochen Luhmann argues that both approaches to carbon pricing make      sense. They actually complement one another.}},

However, reliable empirical evidence of the abatement cost of green-house gases across countries remains scant. In this study we estimate the average yearly green-house gas abatement costs per capita for a panel of 28 OECD countries in years 1990–2015. The marginal abatement costs are estimated using a novel data-driven approach based on convex quantile regression. Compared to traditional frontier estimation methods, the quantile approach takes into account a broader set of abatement options and is more robust to inefficiency, noise, and heteroscedasticity in empirical data. The comparison of OECD countries shows that the actual abatement cost per capita has been very modest, much lower than predicted in the late 1990s. This result has profound policy implications, calling for more ambitious climate change mitigation strategy in the future.}},

The first methodological contribution of this paper is to clarify the conceptual distinction between the shadow price and MAC in order to analyze three sources of upward bias due to the limited set of abatement options, inefficiency, and noisy data. Our second methodological contribution is to develop a novel MAC estimation approach based on convex quantile regression. Compared to the traditional methods, convex quantile regression is more robust to the choice of the direction vector, random noise, and heteroscedasticity. Empirical application to the U.S. electric power plants demonstrates that the upward bias of DEA may be a serious problem in real-world applications.}},

Existing studies rarely emphasized the impact of random noise on MAC estimation, and downscaling the production activity is conventionally applied as the only measure for emission abatement while the possibilities of other measures, such as increase the investment, are often neglected. This paper estimates the least MAC of CO2 for Chinese iron and steel enterprises using a stochastic semi-nonparametric method which considers both inefficiency and random noise. Multiple measures including downscaling the production activity and increasing the inputs investment, are all considered for identifying the least-cost measure for reducing emissions. In addition, the strategies corresponding to adjustment on production and response to environmental regulation of each enterprise are included in the estimation, which makes it possible for identifying the upper and lower bound of MACs. Empirical results indicate that i) the stochastic semi-nonparametric method provides a more consistent estimates with the production process, ii) the average MAC of CO2 emissions in China's iron and steel industry ranges from 2.07 to 2395 yuan/ton, and iii) increasing labor is identified as the least-cost abatement measures for most of the iron and steel enterprises listed in China's top 500 enterprise.

Using panel data of 30 Chinese provinces during 1997–2015, we first estimate the marginal CO2 abatement costs using a novel data-driven approach, convex quantile regression. Based on the marginal abatement cost estimates and China's plans regarding carbon intensity reduction and economic growth, we present a forward-looking assessment of the abatement costs for Chinese provinces for 2016–2020. Our main finding is that all the Chinese provinces have a negative abatement cost, which means these provinces can benefit from an increase in the absolute level of CO2 emissions despite the constraint on carbon intensity. The magnitudes of economic benefits exhibit a significant regional disparity because some provinces can increase more CO2 emissions than others. However, there is still costly carbon intensity abatement relative to a counterfactual where the provinces meet their economic growth targets but in the absence of the intensity reduction constraints. Policy implications have been proposed to enhance the efficiency and fairness of climate policy in China.}},

It is found that the period medians of the MACs for the three emissions all increase over time, while the medians of the MACs for different cities tend to vary significantly. A goodness-of-fit criterion is developed and used to evaluate the fit of alternative models, which demonstrates the superiority of the multi-pollutant model.

However, the way compliance with regulations is      actually enacted or “performed” within organizations instead of merely      executed, remains largely under-characterized. Evidence from an      ethnographic study in the compliance unit of a French investment bank      allows us to develop a detailed practice approach to how regulation is      actually implemented in firms. We characterize the work accomplished by      compliance analysts who are in fact, “curving” the script of regulation      within what we conceptualize as a “comfort zone”. Beyond agency, ethics      appears as a key element in linking the “letter of the law”, which serves      as a referential anchor to guide action, with the complex nature of      specific situations. We analyze the way individuals and compliance teams      cope with, interpret, struggle and in fine, perform regulation within this      comfort zone. A particular interest is thus given to the work of embedded      ethics in this process, as an enabler to partly recouple compliance with      the regulated activity. We find that blind execution is not only      impossible, but also devoid of meaning both from regulatory, risk      management, and business perspectives in organizations. We highlight and      characterize a hermeneutic dimension to this work, essential to      effectively perform regulation in complex environments, and we suggest      some directions for further research.}},

A regression analysis is undertaken to examine the factors that drive shadow prices. Our results indicate that there are large inefficiencies in terms of electricity production and CO2 emissions. The shadow price is a negative function of firm size, age, and coal share, and is positively correlated with the technology level. This correlation between shadow prices and its determinants is not sensitive to changing assumptions regarding directional vectors, although such changes do alter the distribution of shadow prices.

This allows us to treat pollutants as joint outputs, yet accounts for their 'undesirability'. We estimate the distance function for a sample of coal-fired electric power plants from 1985 to 1998, which includes the first 4 years of Phase I of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. We focus on the interaction between SO2 and NOx, as they became more highly regulated and estimate shadow prices of the pollutants and the Morishima elasticity of transformation between two pollutants, NOx and SO2, as well as with respect to the desirable output, kilowatt-hours of electricity. As expected, we find that power plants increase NOx emissions as they decrease SO2, i.e. they are substitutes. © 2012 Taylor \&amp; Francis.}},

abstract = {{CO2 capture and storage (CCS) is receiving considerable attention as a      potential greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation option for fossil fuel power      plants. Cost and performance estimates for CCS are critical factors in      energy and policy analysis. CCS cost studies necessarily employ a host of      technical and economic assumptions that can dramatically affect results.      Thus, particular studies often are of limited value to analysts,      researchers, and industry personnel seeking results for alternative cases.      In this paper, we use a generalized modeling tool to estimate and compare      the emissions, efficiency, resource requirements and current costs of      fossil fuel power plants with CCS on a systematic basis. This plant-level      analysis explores a broader range of key assumptions than found in recent      studies we reviewed for three major plant types: pulverized coal (PC)      plants, natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) plants, and integrated      gasification combined cycle (IGCC) systems using coal. In particular, we      examine the effects of recent increases in capital costs and natural gas      prices, as well as effects of differential plant utilization rates, IGCC      financing and operating assumptions, variations in plant size, and      differences in fuel quality, including bituminous, sub-bituminous and      lignite coals. Our results show higher power plant and CCS costs than      prior studies as a consequence of recent escalations in capital and      operating costs. The broader range of cases also reveals differences not      previously reported in the relative costs of PC, NGCC and IGCC plants with      and without CCS. While CCS can significantly reduce power plant emissions      of CO2 (typically by 85–90\%), the impacts of CCS energy requirements on      plant-level resource requirements and multi-media environmental emissions      also are found to be significant, with increases of approximately 15–30\%      for current CCS systems. To characterize such impacts, an alternative      definition of the “energy penalty” is proposed in lieu of the prevailing      use of this term.}},

We focus particular      attention on the sensitivity of compliance costs under each policy to      unexpected changes in future economic conditions. To illustrate the issue,      we evaluate the policies under two plausible alternative assumptions about      a single aspect of the future world economy: the rate of productivity      growth in Russia. We find that moderate growth in Russia would raise the      cost of the Kyoto Protocol by as much as 50 percent but would have little      effect on the cost of the alternative policy. We conclude that the Kyoto      Protocol is inherently unstable because unexpected future events could      raise compliance costs substantially and place enormous pressure on      governments to abrogate the agreement. The alternative policy would be far      more stable because it does not subject future governments to adverse      shocks in compliance costs.}},

The EU-wide target under the Kyoto      Protocol to the Framework Convention on Climate Change is a reduction in      emissions to 8\% below 1990 levels. EPPA emissions projections are similar      to other recent modeling results, but there are underlying differences in      energy and carbon intensities among the projections. If EU countries were      to individually meet the EU allocation of the Community-wide carbon cap      specified in the Kyoto Protocol, we find using EPPA that carbon prices      vary from \$91 in the United Kingdom to \$385 in Denmark; welfare costs      range from 0.6\% to 5\%.}},

Results of a longitudinal study of stock repurchase programs      over a six-year time period show that decoupling is more likely to occur      when top executives have power over boards to avoid institutional      pressures for change and when social structural or experiential factors      enhance awareness among powerful actors of the potential for      organizational decoupling.

We find that a substantial number of firms are likely to      adopt but not actually use-or only limitedly use-LTIPs, suggesting a      potential separation of substance and symbol in CEO compensation      contracts. Analyses suggest that this decoupling of LTIP adoption and use      is particularly prevalent in firms with powerful CEOs and firms with poor      prior performance. Further analyses show that whereas early adopters are      more likely to pursue alignment between CEO and shareholder interests      substantively, later adopters may pursue legitimacy by symbolically      controlling agency costs.

abstract = {{This paper offers a methodology to address the endogeneity of inputs in      the directional technology distance function (DTDF)-based formulation of      banking technology which explicitly accommodates the presence of      undesirable nonperforming loans---an inherent characteristic of the bank's      production due to its exposure to credit risk. Specifically, we model      nonperforming loans as an undesirable output in the bank's production      process. Since the stochastic DTDF describing banking technology is likely      to suffer from the endogeneity of inputs, we propose addressing this      problem by considering a system consisting of the DTDF and the first-order      conditions from the bank's cost minimization problem. The first-order      conditions also allow us to identify the `cost-optimal' directional vector      for the banking DTDF, thus eliminating the uncertainty associated with an      ad hoc choice of the direction. We apply our cost system approach to the      data on large US commercial banks for the 2001--2010 period, which we      estimate via Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods subject to      theoretical regularity conditions. We document dramatic distortions in      banks' efficiency, productivity growth and scale elasticity estimates when      the endogeneity of inputs is assumed away and/or the DTDF is fitted in an      arbitrary direction.

The      findings show that organizational actors express constructions of the      regulator as an ally, threat, and obstacle that vary with organizational      expertise, authority, and continuity of relationship between the      organizational member and the regulator. The article makes three      contributions to the current understandings of organizational governance      and regulatory compliance, thereby extending both institutional and      ecological accounts of organizations' behavior with respect to their      environments. First, the authors document not only variation across      organizations but variable compliance within an organization. Second, the      variations described do not derive from alternative institutional logics,      but from variations in positions, autonomy, and expertise within each      organization. From their grounded theory, the authors hypothesize that      these constructions carry differential normative interpretations of      regulation and probabilities for compliance, and thus the third      contribution, the typology, when correlated with organizational hierarchy      provides the link between microlevel action and discourse and      organizational performance.}},

The      study illustrates how the recent developments in efficiency analysis and      statistical inference can be applied when evaluating environmental      performance issues. The results indicate a nonlinear relationship between      countries' obliged percentage levels of emission reductions and their      environmental efficiency levels. Finally, a similar nonlinear relationship      is also recorded between the duration which a country has signed the KPA      and its environmental efficiency levels.}},

So we started over      determined to write something new. At first we thought this approach might      not work as a coherent mono graph, which is why we chose the essay format      rather than chapters. As it turns out, there is a common thread—namely the      directional distance function, which also gave us our title. As you shall      see, the directional distance function includes traditional distance      functions and efficiency measures as special cases providing a unifying      framework for existing productivity and efficiency measures. It is also      flexible enough to open up new areas in productivity and efficiency      analysis such as environmen tal and aggregation issues. That we did not      see this earlier is humbling; a student at a recent conference raised his      hand and asked 'Why didn't you start with the directional distance      function in the first place? In deed. This manuscript is intended to make      up for our earlier oversights.
