               1994, the relationship between performance and revenue is
               investigated using cointegration and causality tests. A
               cointegrating relationship between performance and revenue is
               established in only 10 cases out of 77, although it is argued
               that some caution is required in interpreting these results, due
               to the low power of the relevant tests in relatively small

               causality running from lagged revenue to current performance
               than of causality in the opposite direction, while the
               dependence of performance on revenue seems to be greater for the
               smaller clubs than for the larger. These results lend empirical

              credit unions) provides a valuable testing ground for assessing
              the impact of capital regulation and theories of managerial
              behaviour in financial institutions. Limited access to external
              equity capital means that capital accumulation must be met
              primarily by reliance on retained earnings. To deal with shocks
              to the capital position and avoid breaching regulatory
              requirements, managers will aim to have a buffer of capital in
              excess of the regulatory minimum. Moreover, mutual governance
              arrangements and an absence of capital market discipline mean
              that managers have discretion to set target capital ratios which
              differ significantly from industry averages. This paper develops
              a formal model of capital management and risk management in
              mutual financial institutions such as credit unions which
              reflects these industry characteristics. The model is tested
              using data from larger credit unions in Australia, which have
              been subject to the Basel Accord Risk Weighted Capital
              Requirements since 1993. The data supports the hypothesis that
              credit unions manage their capital position by setting a short
              term target profit rate (return on assets) which is positively
              related to asset growth and which is aimed at gradually removing
              discrepancies between the actual and desired capital ratio.
              Desired capital ratios vary significantly across credit unions.

              alters the share of non-interest income is decomposed into a

              interest and non-interest bearing activities, and an indirect

              trading on long‐term price changes. The fast speculator's

              weights to minimise the variance of the portfolio for a given

              covariance matrix that represents the volatility and correlation
              of asset returns. However these matrices are notoriously
              difficult to estimate and ad hoc methods often need to be applied
              to limit or smooth the mean-variance efficient allocations that
              are recommended by the model. Moreover the mean- variance
              criterion has nothing to ensure that tracking errors are
              stationary. Although the portfolios will be efficient, the
              tracking errors will in all probability be random walks.
              Therefore the replicating portfolio can drift very far from the
              benchmark unless it is frequently re-balanced. A significant
              difference between traditional hedge fund strategies and the

              devise allocations that always have stationary tracking errors.

                 parametric DEA analysis, how the choice of risk management
                 control variable impacts upon such estimates. Using the model
                 of Liu et al. (2010), we examine the dependency of the
                 estimated technical efficiency scores on the chosen risk
                 control variables embracing loan loss provisions and equity as
                 good inputs and non-performing loans as a bad output. We duly
                 find that, both for individual banks and banking groups, the
                 mean estimates are indeed model dependent although, for the
                 former, rank correlations do not change much at the extremes.
                 Based on the application of the Simar and Zelenyuk (2006)
                 adapted Li (1996) test, we then find that, if only one of the
                 three risk control variables is to be included in such an
                 analysis, then it should be loan loss provisions. We also
                 show, however, that the inclusion of all three risk control
                 variable is to be preferred to just including one, but that
                 the inclusion of two such variables is about as good as
                 including all three. We therefore conclude that the optimal
                 approach is to include (any) two of the three risk control
                 variables identified. The wider implication for research into
                 bank efficiency is that the optimal choice of risk management
                 control variable is likely to be crucial to both the delivery
                 of un-biased estimates of bank efficiency and the

              complex ways an analyst develops his or her mind in order to
              become an effective analyst. Grossman sought to detail the many
              subtle factors infusing Freudian theory, from its initial sources
              to its consolidation as a system, to its embrace in the mind of
              an analyst who will use it, and on to the many iterations of its
              progress on the way to being applied in the clinical situation.
              This progression assumes a recognition of the analyst's need to
              be at once both experiencer and observer. Implicit in the attempt
              to understand another is a self-reflective taking of oneself as
              an object of analysis. How an essential tension is worked out

  abstract = "Often researchers find parametric models restrictive and
              sensitive to deviations from the parametric specifications;
              semi-nonparametric models are more flexible and robust, but lead
              to other complications such as introducing infinite-dimensional
              parameter spaces that may not be compact and the optimization
              problem may no longer be well-posed. The method of sieves
              provides one way to tackle such difficulties by optimizing an
              empirical criterion over a sequence of approximating parameter
              spaces (i.e., sieves); the sieves are less complex but are dense
              in the original space and the resulting optimization problem
              becomes well-posed. With different choices of criteria and
              sieves, the method of sieves is very flexible in estimating
              complicated semi-nonparametric models with (or without)
              endogeneity and latent heterogeneity. It can easily incorporate
              prior information and constraints, often derived from economic
              theory, such as monotonicity, convexity, additivity,
              multiplicity, exclusion and nonnegativity. It can simultaneously
              estimate the parametric and nonparametric parts in

              rates for both parts. This chapter describes estimation of

              ``willing suspension of disbelief'' to talk seriously of the
              aggregate production function. But the aggregate production
              function is only a little less legitimate a concept than, say,
              the aggregate consumption function, and for some kinds of
              long-run macro-models it is almost as indispensable as the latter
              is for the short-run. As long as we insist on practicing
              macro-economics we shall need aggregate relationships. Even so,
              there would hardly be any justification for returning to this
              old-fashioned topic if I had no novelty to suggest. The new
              wrinkle I want to describe is an elementary way of segregating
              variations in output per head due to technical change from those
              due to changes in the availability of capital per head.
              Naturally, every additional bit of information has its price. In
              this case the price consists of one new required time series, the
              share of labor or property in total income, and one new
              assumption, that factors are paid their marginal products. Since
              the former is probably more respectable than the other data I
              shall use, and since the latter is an assumption often made, the
              price may not be unreasonably high. Before going on, let me be
              explicit that I would not try to justify what follows by calling
              on fancy theorems on aggregation and index numbers.' Either this
              kind of aggregate economics appeals or it doesn't. Personally I
              belong to both schools. If it does, I think one can draw some

              attach multiple membership groups has contributed significantly
              to rapid growth in the industry. As credit unions add unrelated

  abstract = "Electricity distribution is a natural local monopoly. In many

              such as data envelopment analysis (DEA) or stochastic frontier
              analysis (SFA) to estimate the efficient cost of operation. In
              Finland, a new StoNED method was adopted in 2012. This paper
              compares DEA, SFA and StoNED in the context of regulating
              electricity distribution. Using data from Finland, we compare the
              impacts of methodological choices on cost efficiency estimates
              and acceptable cost. While the efficiency estimates are highly
              correlated, the cost targets reveal major differences. In
              addition, we examine performance of the methods by Monte Carlo
              simulations. We calibrate the data generation process (DGP) to
              closely match the empirical data and the model specification of
              the regulator. We find that the StoNED estimator yields a root
              mean squared error (RMSE) of 4\% with the sample size 100.
              Precision improves as the sample size increases. The DEA
              estimator yields an RMSE of approximately 10\%, but performance
              deteriorates as the sample size increases. The SFA estimator has
              an RMSE of 144\%. The poor performance of SFA is due to the wrong

              these objectives, a new method called stochastic nonparametric

  abstract = "Two-stage data envelopment analysis (2-DEA) is commonly used in
              productive efficiency analysis to estimate the effects of
              operational conditions and practices on performance. In this
              method the DEA efficiency estimates are regressed on contextual
              variables representing the operational conditions. We reexamine
              the statistical properties of the 2-DEA estimator, and find that
              it is statistically consistent under more general conditions than
              earlier studies assume. We further show that the finite sample
              bias of DEA in the first stage carries over to the second stage
              regression, causing bias in the estimated coefficients of the
              contextual variables. This bias is particularly severe when the
              contextual variables are correlated with inputs. To address this
              shortcoming, we apply the result that DEA can be formulated as a
              constrained special case of the convex nonparametric least
              squares (CNLS) regression. Applying the CNLS formulation, we
              develop a new semi-nonparametric one-stage estimator for the
              coefficients of the contextual variables that directly
              incorporates contextual variables to the standard DEA problem.
              The proposed method is hence referred to as one-stage DEA
              (1-DEA). Evidence from Monte Carlo simulations suggests that the
              new 1-DEA estimator performs systematically better than the
              conventional 2-DEA estimator both in deterministic and noisy
              scenarios. \copyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",

  abstract = "The purpose of this paper is twofold. First, in the framework of
              the strategic groups' literature, it analyZes changes in
              productivity and efficiency of Spanish private and savings banks
              over an eight-year period (1998--2006). Second, by adapting the
              decomposition of the Malmquist productivity indices suggested by
              F{\"a}re et al. (1994), it proposes similar components
              decomposing the Luenberger productivity indicator. Initially,
              productivity is decomposed into technological and efficiency
              changes. Thereafter, this efficiency change is decomposed into
              pure efficiency, scale and congestion changes. Empirical results
              demonstrate that productivity improvements are partially due to
              technological innovation. Furthermore, it is shown how the
              competition between private and savings banks develops in terms
              of the analyzed productivity and efficiency components. While
              private banks enjoy better efficiency change, savings banks
              contribute more to technological progress. Consequently, the
              Luenberger components are used as cluster analysis inputs. Thus,
              economic interpretations of the resulting performance groups are
              made via key differences in productivity components. Finally,

              non-parametric methods use Farrell--Debreu, Shephard, or
              hyperbolic radial measures. These approaches require that inputs
              and outputs be non-negative, which can be problematic when using
              financial data. Recently, Chambers et al. (1998) have introduced
              directional distance functions which can be viewed as additive
              (rather than multiplicative) measures efficiency. Directional
              distance functions are not restricted to non-negative input and
              output quantities; in addition, the traditional input and
              output-oriented measures are nested as special cases of
              directional distance functions. Consequently, directional
              distances provide greater flexibility. However, until now, only
              free disposal hull (FDH) estimators of directional distances (and
              their conditional and robust extensions) have known statistical
              properties (Simar and Vanhems, 2012). This paper develops the

              measure the overall performance of a production system composed
              of two stages (processes) in a specified period of time, where
              variations in different periods are ignored. This paper takes the
              operations of individual periods into account to develop a
              multi-period two-stage DEA model, which is able to measure the
              overall and period efficiencies at the same time, with the former
              expressed as a weighted average of the latter. Since the
              efficiency of a two-stage system in a period is the product of
              the two process efficiencies, the overall efficiency of a
              decision making unit (DMU) in the specified period of time can be
              decomposed into the process efficiency of each period. Based on
              this decomposition, the sources of inefficiency in a DMU can be
              identified. The efficiencies measured from the model can also be
              used to calculate a common-weight global Malmquist productivity
              index (MPI) between two periods, in that the overall MPI is the
              product of the two process MPIs. The non-life insurance industry

              method for estimating a monotonic function by fitting a step
              function to data. In the literature of frontier estimation, the
              free disposal hull (FDH) method is similarly based on the minimal
              assumption of monotonicity. In this paper, we link these two
              separately developed nonparametric methods by showing that FDH is
              a sign-constrained variant of INLS. We also discuss the
              connections to related methods such as data envelopment analysis

              examine alternative ways of applying isotonic regression to
              frontier estimation, analogous to corrected and modified ordinary
              least squares (COLS/MOLS) methods known in the parametric stream

              and stochastic settings. In the absence of noise, the corrected
              INLS (CINLS) has a higher discriminating power than FDH. In the

              stochastic envelopment of data (non-convex StoNED), which
              disentangles inefficiency from noise based on the skewness of the

              conceptual treatment of noise. As will be demonstrated in this

              requires that, in the absence of the treatment, the average

              parallel paths over time. This assumption may be implausible if

               characteristics, it is shown that the propensity score is
               ancillary for estimation of the average treatment effects. The

               to estimate in an initial step a weight matrix as required in
               the conventional estimation procedure. Second, it is
               straightforward to derive the distribution of the estimator

               estimators have appealing information-theoretic interpretations.
               In particular, one of the estimators is an empirical likelihood
               estimator with an interpretation as a discrete support maximum

              Difference-In-Difference (DID) method for evaluating the effects
              of policy changes. We propose a model that allows the control
              group and treatment groups to have different average benefits
              from the treatment. The assumptions of the proposed model are
              invariant to the scaling of the outcome. We provide conditions
              under which the model is nonparametrically identified and propose
              an estimator that can be applied using either repeated
              cross-section or panel data. Our ap- proach provides an estimate
              of the entire counterfactual distribution of outcomes that would
              have been experienced by the treatment group in the absence of
              the treatment, and likewise for the untreated group in the
              presence of the treatment. Thus, it enables the evaluation of
              policy interventions according to criteria such as a
              mean-variance tradeoff. We also propose methods for inference,
              showing that our estimator for the average treatment effect is
              root- N consistent and asymptotically normal. We consider

               used in evaluation research despite the fact that their large
               sample properties have not been established in many cases. The
               absence of formal results in this area may be partly due to the
               fact that standard asymptotic expansions do not apply to
               matching estimators with a fixed number of matches because such
               estimators are highly nonsmooth functionals of the data. In this

               properties of matching estimators and establish a number of new
               results. We focus on matching with replacement with a fixed

               not N1/2-consistent in general and describe conditions under

               N1/2-consistent, simple matching estimators with a fixed number
               of matches do not attain the semiparametric efficiency bound.

              effect of tax exemption to Subchapter S banks on stakeholders and
              on job creation. Specifically, we investigate the effect of
              adoption of Subchapter S status on the four stakeholders of the
              banks: the customers of the bank, the employees of the bank, the
              owners of the bank and the government. The results indicate that
              the tax exemptions to Subchapter S banks do not create new jobs,
              and that the owners of the bank are the sole beneficiary of the
              tax exemptions since there is a significant increase in bank's
              return on equity after it adopts the Subchapter S status. vThe

              Subchapter S banks: who shares higher tax benefits with
              customers?'' examines whether credit unions are doing a better
              job of sharing the tax benefit with its customers. The results
              indicate that the credit union members do not receive the benefit
              in terms of lower loan rates, higher deposit rates or lower
              service charges. The findings also indicate that tax exemptions
              have been directed to support inefficient operations. The third

              and Subchapter S banks'' compares the asset quality of for-profit
              Subchapter S banks with not-for-profit credit unions. The results
              indicate that credit unions have better asset quality, but

               envelopment analysis (DEA) techniques, mean efficiency scores
               generally exhibit volatile patterns over time. This appears to
               be at odds with the general perception of learning-by-doing
               management, due to Arrow [The economic implications of learning
               by doing. Review of Economic Studies 1964; 154-73]. Further,
               this phenomenon is largely attributable to the fundamental
               assumption of deterministic data maintained in DEA models, and
               to the difficulty such models have in incorporating

               method to measure DEA efficiency while controlling for the

               control of €14.3bn and a membership of 2.5m which equates to
               about 66\% of the economically active population, the highest
               penetration level of any country. That said, the Irish movement
               sits at a critical development stage, well behind mature markets
               such as Canada and the US in terms of product provision,
               technological sophistication, fragmentation of trade bodies and
               regulatory environment. This study analyses relative cost
               efficiency or performance of Irish credit unions using the
               popular frontier approach which measures an entity's efficiency
               relative to a frontier of best practice. Parametric techniques
               are utilised, with variation in inefficiency being attributed to
               credit union-specific factors. The stochastic cost frontier
               parameters and the credit-union specific parameters are
               simultaneously estimated to produce valid statistical
               inferences. The study finds that the majority of Irish credit
               unions are not operating at optimal levels. It further

              was mooted that the documented high levels of inefficiency may be
              indicative of the fact that credit unions, based on clearly
              defined and non-overlapping common bonds, are not in competition

               Western world over the next fifty years or so. The change is not
               only demographic, but social and financial as well. We have the
               enormous advantage however that the change can be seen coming
               from a long way off, and will not burst on us suddenly and
               unexpectedly. There is therefore little excuse for not preparing
               for it. The problem is certainly well known, although it is
               arguably often not well understood. In Britain, at least as far
               as pensions are concerned, it is often seen as much more of a
               problem for our continental European neighbours than for us,
               both because our population is ageing less fast and because we
               have a pension system that is largely funded. There is also a
               perception that Britain has already taken action to deal with
               the problem. Measures such as indexation of the state pension to
               prices rather than wages, cutting back on SERPS, encouraging
               funded personal pensions, and raising the state retirement age
               for women, all seem to have helped to reduce the problem, or at
               least the apparent problem. This paper challenges some of these
               perceptions. It concentrates however on the implications of
               population ageing for pensions. It is not concerned, other than
               marginally, with other possible effects, for instance on the

  abstract = "Pensions influence retirement decisions. The analysis provides a
              framework for assessing the phenomenon. The qualitative features
              of most defined benefit pension plans in the United States, as
              the first section demonstrates, can be used to induce optimal
              retirement choices. Pensions are viewed as a form of forced
              savings; their purposeis to enable the worker to ``commit
              himself'' by making it in his own self-interest to retire at an
              appropriate age. The remaining sections examine the use of
              pensions in populations that are heterogeneous with respect to
              such features as disutility of work or expected lifespan.Given
              heterogeneity, a major policy concern is whether pensions are
              actuarially fair to different groups, retirement cohorts,etc. It
              is proven that optimal pension plans cannot be actuarially more
              than fair, in the sense that someone who retires later must
              impose a smaller cost on the pension pool than he would were he
              to retire earlier. However, there are differences in life
              expectancy among cohorts defined by retirement age: late retirees
              generallyl ive longer. Late retirees may thus impose a greater
              expected cost on the pension fund under an optimal plan;
              interestingly, they do impose a higher cost than those retiring
              earlier under most common pension funds.In a first-best world, a
              separate pension plan would be designed for each group of
              workers. But, government-mandated retirement programs and
              legislation regulating private pensions require common treatment
              of different workers. Such homogenization is shown to work to the
              possible detriment of workers as a whole. Pensions are a
              workhorse compensation mechanism. They provide an additional
              instrument beyond wages for attracting, motivating, sorting, and
              retaining workers, while facilitating appropriate retirement
              decisions.",

              at the focal point of behavioral sciences such as neuroscience,
              economics, and finance. Many influential models from these
              sciences assume that financial risk preferences form a stable
              trait. Is this assumption justified and, if not, what causes the
              appetite for risk to fluctuate? We have previously found that
              traders experience a sustained increase in the stress hormone
              cortisol when the amount of uncertainty, in the form of market
              volatility, increases. Here we ask whether these elevated
              cortisol levels shift risk preferences. Using a double-blind,
              placebo-controlled, cross-over protocol we raised cortisol levels
              in volunteers over 8 d to the same extent previously observed in
              traders. We then tested for the utility and probability weighting
              functions underlying their risk taking and found that
              participants became more risk-averse. We also observed that the
              weighting of probabilities became more distorted among men

              are highly dynamic. Specifically, the stress response calibrates
              risk taking to our circumstances, reducing it in times of
              prolonged uncertainty, such as a financial crisis.
              Physiology-induced shifts in risk preferences may thus be an

  abstract = "The performance of health service providers may be monitored by
              measuring productivity. However, the policy value of such
              measures may depend crucially on the accuracy of input and output
              measures. In particular, an important question is how to adjust
              adequately for case-mix in the production of health care. In this
              study, we assess productivity growth in Norwegian outpatient
              child and adolescent mental health service units (CAMHS) over a
              period characterized by governmental utilization of simple
              productivity indices, a substantial increase in capacity and a
              concurrent change in case-mix. We analyze the sensitivity of the
              productivity growth estimates using different specifications of
              output to adjust for case-mix differences. Case-mix adjustment is
              achieved by distributing patients into eight groups depending on
              reason for referral, age and gender, as well as correcting for
              the number of consultations. We utilize the nonparametric Data
              Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method to implicitly calculate weights
              that maximize each unit's efficiency. Malmquist indices of
              technical productivity growth are estimated and bootstrap
              procedures are performed to calculate confidence intervals and to
              test alternative specifications of outputs. The dataset consist
              of an unbalanced panel of 48-60 CAMHS in the period 1998-2006.
              The mean productivity growth estimate from a simple unadjusted
              patient model (one single output) is 35\%; adjusting for case-mix
              (eight outputs) reduces the growth estimate to 15\%. Adding
              consultations increases the estimate to 28\%. The latter reflects
              an increase in number of consultations per patient. We find that
              the governmental productivity indices strongly tend to
              overestimate productivity growth. Case-mix adjustment is of major
              importance and governmental utilization of performance indicators

  author    = "Damodaran, Aswath",
  abstract  = "Equity risk premiums are a central component of every risk and
               return model in finance and are a key input into estimating
               costs of equity and capital in both corporate finance and
               valuation. Given their importance, it is surprising how
               haphazard the estimation of equity risk premiums remains in
               practice. We begin this paper by looking at the economic
               determinants of equity risk premiums, including investor risk
               aversion, information uncertainty and perceptions of
               macroeconomic risk. In the standard approach to estimating
               equity risk premiums, historical returns are used, with the
               difference in annual returns on stocks versus bonds over a long
               time period comprising the expected risk premium. We note the
               limitations of this approach, even in markets like the United
               States, which have long periods of historical data available,
               and its complete failure in emerging markets, where the
               historical data tends to be limited and volatile. We look at two
               other approaches to estimating equity risk premiums -- the
               survey approach, where investors and managers are asked to
               assess the risk premium and the implied approach, where a
               forward-looking estimate of the premium is estimated using
               either current equity prices or risk premiums in non-equity
               markets. We also look at the relationship between the equity
               risk premium and risk premiums in the bond market (default
               spreads) and in real estate (cap rates) and how that
               relationship can be mined to generated expected equity risk
               premiums. We close the paper by examining why different
               approaches yield different values for the equity risk premium,
               and how to choose the ``right'' number to use in analysis.",

              the performance of a two-stage evaluation methodology that (a)
              estimates the probability that a person participates in a
              programme and (b) uses the estimated probability in extensions of
              the classical method of matching. We decompose the conventional
              measure of programme evaluation bias into several components and
              find that bias due to selection on unobservables, commonly called
              selection bias in econometrics, is empirically less important
              than other components, although it is still a sizeable fraction
              of the estimated programme impact. Matching methods applied to
              comparison groups located in the same labour markets as
              participants and administered the same questionnaire eliminate
              much of the bias as conventionally measured, but the remaining
              bias is a considerable fraction of experimentally-determined
              programme impact estimates. We test and reject the identifying

              present a nonparametric conditional difference-in-differences

  abstract  = "Today US credit unions operate within a highly competitive
               financial market place. Set against this competitive operating
               environment, the present study employs stochastic frontier
               analysis to evaluate the performance of large credit unions
               (assets greater than \$50 million) over the period 1993 to 2001.
               Although credit unions may share a common co-operative
               philosophy, differences between credit unions are also apparent
               across a range of operational, structural and locational
               characteristics (environmental conditions). The impact of these
               different environmental influences is modelled in two ways. One
               assumes that environmental factors affect the efficiency with
               which the production process is operated, while the second
               assumes that the environment affects the production process
               itself. Net and gross cost efficiency measures are obtained for
               both models, with the differences between these measures for a
               specific credit union being viewed as the impact that
               environmental variables have on the inefficiency of that credit
               union. In addition, if it is assumed that the main environmental
               factors are accounted for in the modelling, then a credit
               union's net efficiency measure may be interpreted as a measure
               of managerial performance when operating in equivalent
               environments. The analysis revealed that different environments
               (the age of the credit union; the potential for expansion within
               the existing common bond; whether the credit union has the
               option of expansion through the addition of select employee
               groups; whether the credit union is state or federally
               regulated; whether insurance is provided at state or federal
               level; as well as regional characteristics such as per capita
               income and the level of unemployment) account for much of the
               variability in cost efficiency between credit unions and once
               credit unions are placed in broadly equivalent operating

  abstract = "Accurate short-term natural gas (NG) demand estimation and
              forecasting is vital for policy and decision-making process in
              energy sector. Moreover, conventional methods may not provide
              accurate results. This paper presents an adaptive network-based
              fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for estimation of NG demand.
              Standard input variables are used which are day of the week,
              demand of the same day in previous year, demand of a day before
              and demand of 2 days before. The proposed ANFIS approach is
              equipped with pre-processing and post-processing concepts.
              Moreover, input data are pre-processed (scaled) and finally
              output data are post-processed (returned to its original scale).
              The superiority and applicability of the ANFIS approach is shown
              for Iranian NG consumption from 22/12/2007 to 30/6/2008. Results
              show that ANFIS provides more accurate results than artificial
              neural network (ANN) and conventional time series approach. The
              results of this study provide policy makers with an appropriate
              tool to make more accurate predictions on future short-term NG

               forecasting of electricity loads. Two building blocks of our
               approach are (1) modeling the overall trend and seasonality by
               fitting a generalized additive model to the weekly averages of
               the load and (2) modeling the dependence structure across
               consecutive daily loads via curve linear regression. For the
               latter, a new methodology is proposed for linear regression with
               both curve response and curve regressors. The key idea behind
               the proposed methodology is dimension reduction based on a
               singular value decomposition in a Hilbert space, which reduces
               the curve regression problem to several ordinary (i.e., scalar)
               linear regression problems. We illustrate the hybrid method

              system planning, operation, and control. Many operating decisions
              are based on load forecasts, such as dispatch scheduling of
              generating capacity, reliability analysis, and maintenance
              planning for the generators. Overestimation of electricity demand
              will cause a conservative operation, which leads to the start-up
              of too many units or excessive energy purchase, thereby supplying
              an unnecessary level of reserve. On the other hand,
              underestimation may result in a risky operation, with
              insufficient preparation of spinning reserve, causing the system
              to operate in a vulnerable region to the disturbance. In this
              paper, semi-parametric additive models are proposed to estimate
              the relationships between demand and the driver variables.
              Specifically, the inputs for these models are calendar variables,

              (return-based) style analysis. First, style analysis may be used
              to estimate the relevant factor exposures of a fund. We use a
              simple simulation experiment to show that imposing portfolio and
              positivity constraints in style analysis leads to significant
              efficiency gains if the factor loadings are indeed positively
              weighted portfolios, in particular when the factors have low
              cross-correlations. If this is not the case though, imposing the
              constraints can lead to biased exposure estimates. Second, style
              analysis may be used in performance measurement. If the actual
              factor exposures are a positively weighted portfolio and if the
              risk-free rate is one of the benchmarks, then the intercept
              coincides with the Jensen measure. In general, the intercept in
              the style regression can only be interpreted as a special case of
              the familiar Jensen measure. Third, style estimates may be
              compared with actual portfolio holdings. We show that the actual
              portfolio holdings will in general not reveal the actual
              investment style of a fund because of cross exposures between the
              asset classes and because fund managers may hold securities that
              on average do not have a beta of one relative to their own asset
              class. Although return-based style analysis is less suitable to
              predict future portfolio holdings, our empirical analysis
              suggests that it performs better than holding-based style

               Separating uncertainty of outcome effects by season, the results
               show that, at best, uncertainty of outcome had imprecise effects
               on audiences in earlier seasons, but zero effects in later
               seasons. Television audiences have evolved to exhibit
               preferences for talent. We suggest that the notion of a pure

               one or more forms of policy intervention such as revenue sharing

               literature was initially directed towards the theoretical
               effects of these policies on competitive balance, wage rates and
               owner profits in the context of Major US sports leagues. That
               work has since been broadened in the literature to include other
               types of policy intervention and other model assumptions such as
               `win maximising' owners and `open' labour markets that

              the number of resulting invasive diagnostic procedures remains
              problematic. Measurement of circulating cell-free DNA in maternal
              plasma might offer improvement. METHODS: A blinded, nested
              case-control study was designed within a cohort of 4664
              pregnancies at high risk for Down syndrome. Fetal karyotyping was
              compared with an internally validated, laboratory-developed test
              based on next-generation sequencing in 212 Down syndrome and 1484
              matched euploid pregnancies. None had been previously tested.
              Primary testing occurred at a CLIA-certified commercial
              laboratory, with cross validation by a CLIA-certified university
              laboratory. RESULTS: Down syndrome detection rate was 98.6\%
              (209/212), the false-positive rate was 0.20\% (3/1471), and the
              testing failed in 13 pregnancies (0.8\%); all were euploid.
              Before unblinding, the primary testing laboratory also reported
              multiple alternative interpretations. Adjusting chromosome 21
              counts for guanine cytosine base content had the largest impact
              on improving performance. CONCLUSION: When applied to high-risk
              pregnancies, measuring maternal plasma DNA detects nearly all
              cases of Down syndrome at a very low false-positive rate. This
              method can substantially reduce the need for invasive diagnostic
              procedures and attendant procedure-related fetal losses. Although
              implementation issues need to be addressed, the evidence supports
              introducing this testing on a clinical basis.",

              context. Specifically, the paper seeks to examine whether
              in‐sample measures of best‐fit and also past forecasting accuracy

              accuracy of the alternative specifications is compared with
              specific attention placed on the accuracy of the respective
              specification that in‐sample provides the best fitting

  abstract  = "Cooperative banks are an important, and growing, part of many
               financial systems. This paper empirically analyzes the role of
               cooperative banks in financial stability. Contrary to some
               suggestions in the literature, we find that cooperative banks
               are more stable than commercial banks. This finding is due to
               the lower volatility of the cooperative banks' returns, which
               more than offsets their lower profitability and capitalization.
               This is most likely due to cooperative banks' ability to use
               customer surplus as a cushion in weaker periods. We also find
               that in systems with a high presence of cooperative banks, weak
               commercial banks are less stable than they would be otherwise.
               The overall impact of a higher cooperative presence on bank
               stability is positive on average but insignificant in some
               specifications.",

              conventional paradigm suggests that ``community banks'' -- small,

              strong relationships with informationally opaque small

              institutions -- tend to serve more transparent firms. Using the
              2003 Survey of Small Business Finance (SSBF), we conduct two sets
              of tests. First, we test for the type of bank serving as the
              ``main'' relationship bank for small businesses with different
              firm and owner characteristics. Second, we test for the strength

               the finance gap, particularly for young firms. The aim of
               legislation introduced in the UK in 2012 is to utilise the
               credit union sector to increase the amount of new lending to
               SMEs. The rationale for this legislative change arises because
               credit unions typically operate within a defined geographic
               region wherefrom they can compile detailed local knowledge of
               small businesses and be therefore uniquely placed to minimise
               information asymmetries thereby reducing the funding gap for
               small firms. Despite this perceived advantage, credit unions
               have been reluctant to take advantage of this legislative, and
               therefore lending by credit unions to SMEs has been negligent to
               date. We investigate the reasons for this lack of engagement in
               SME lending by interviewing the chief executives of five credit
               unions in Scotland. Our findings reveal that the CEOs of the
               credit unions are reluctant to lend to SMEs at present as they
               are uncomfortable with the level of risk associated with lending
               to a sector of which they have little experience or expertise.
               Furthermore, credit unions will need to offer attractive
               interest rates to compete with high street banks and an
               increasing number of microcredit providers. Policy makers need
               to better understand the structure and function of credit unions
               before assigning a greater role in SME lending. It is too early
               to say whether credit unions can play a significant role in SME
               lending, and our evidence suggests that structural issues must
               first be resolved before they become an established presence in
               the SME lending ecosystem.",

              portfolio management. In this paper, a generalized data
              envelopment analysis (DEA) model is developed to analyze a firm's
              financial statements over time in order to determine a relative
              financial strength indicator (RFSI) that is predictive of firm's
              stock price returns. RFSI is based on maximizing the correlation
              between the DEA-based score of financial strength and the stock
              market performance. This maximization involves a difficult binary
              nonlinear program that requires iterative re-configuration of
              parameters of financial statements as inputs and outputs. We
              utilize a two-step heuristic algorithm that combines random
              sampling and local search optimization. The proposed approach is
              tested with 230 firms from various US technology-industries to
              determine optimized RFSI indicators for stock selection. Then,
              those selected stocks are used within portfolio optimization

               then in the second stage use those deposits to generate a

               scale, economies of scope, and other production characteristics
               in a multiproduct context. The regression results indicate that
               most of the credit unions in our sample experience significant
               increasing returns to scale as they expand their level of
               output. There is also evidence of cost complementarity or
               economies of scope in their mortgage and other lending
               activities. As a result, legislation which limits the ability of
               credit unions to grow and diversify will likely raise the
               operating costs of this important group of financial
               institutions. Additional structural tests of the most general

               Typically, researchers compute only the precision of individual
               efficiency rankings. Recently, Horrace and Schmidt (Journal of
               Applied Economics 15, 1--26, 2000) have applied sampling

               For these methods and a parametric bootstrap technique, we carry

               the stochastic frontier and the way in which u depends on z, and
               can be estimated in a single step, for example by maximum
               likelihood. This is in contrast to a ``two-step'' procedure,
               where the first step is to estimate a standard stochastic

               relationship between (estimated) u and z.In this paper we

              are modeled as stochastic variables, (ii) random noise in terms
              of measurement errors, sample noise, and specification errors is
              made an integral part of the model, and (iii) the frontier is
              stochastic as is the underlying Production Possibility Set (PPS).
              Stochastic DEA utilizes non-parametric convex or conical hull
              reference technologies based upon axioms from production theory
              accompanied by a statistical foundation in terms of axioms from
              statistics or distributional assumptions. The approaches allow
              for an estimation of stochastic inefficiency compared to a
              deterministic or a stochastic PPS and for statistical inference
              while maintaining an axiomatic foundation. Focus is on bridges

              management science approach imposes a restrictive structure on
              inefficiency, which may not facilitate the communication of
              results of the analysis to decision makers. Semi-parametric SFA
              and CCDEA differ w.r.t. the modeling of noise and stochastic
              inefficiency. The two approaches are in spite of the inherent
              differences shown to be complements in the sense that the
              stochastic PPSs obtained by the two approaches share basic
              similarities in the case of one output and multiple inputs.
              Recent contributions related to (i) disentangling of random noise
              and random inefficiency and (ii) obtaining smooth shape
              constrained estimators of the frontier are discussed.",

               skewness is the key testable hypothesis of the frontier
               approach. We propose to test the regression residuals for
               skewness in order to distinguish the two competing approaches.

               other over corporation taxes, and whether such competition can
               explain the fall in statutory tax rates in the 1980s and 1990s.
               We develop a model in which multinational firms choose their
               capital stock in response to an effective marginal tax rate
               (EMTR), and simultaneously choose the location of their profit
               in response to differences in statutory tax rates. Governments
               engage in two-dimensional tax competition: they simultaneously
               compete over EMTRs for capital and over statutory rates for
               profit. We estimate the parameters of their reaction functions
               using data from 21 countries between 1982 and 1999. We find
               evidence that countries compete over both measures, and
               moreover, that the estimated slopes of reaction functions are
               consistent with our theoretical predictions. We find that --
               consistent with our model, but not some other forms of
               competition -- evidence of strategic interaction is present only
               between open economies (i.e. those without capital controls in
               place). The Nash equilibrium average statutory rates implied by
               the empirical model fall substantially over the period, in line
               with falls in actual statutory rates. The reductions in
               equilibrium tax rates can be explained almost entirely by more
               intense competition generated by the relaxation of capital

              opportunity cost. Such analysis requires consideration of whether
              time displaced in the production of health involves lost work or
              lost leisure. Furthermore, because valuation of opportunity cost
              requires the consistent treatment of costs and benefits, the
              study also considers the valuation of outputs. The basis for
              valuing the shadow price of work time is examined by firstly
              assuming perfect competition. The analysis then considers the
              presence of monopoly and monopsony in product markets and income
              and sales taxes. The basis for valuing the shadow price of
              leisure (``leisure' being all uses of time except paid
              employment) is restricted to an examination of methods previously
              used to value unpaid housework. The two methods examined are the
              replacement cost and the opportunity cost method. As the methods
              are not equivalent, the circumstances where each is appropriate
              vary depending on whether the output lost in producing health is
              replaced. Although not set out as the primary focus of the paper,
              the issues surrounding the valuation of outputs generated by
              non-market and quasi-market activity are examined. In particular,
              where activities such as informal care result in indirect utility
              to the carers (and patients) themselves, it is likely the full
              market wage provides a lower bound estimate of the value of
              marginal benefit. Finally the paper provides a practical approach

               statistical approach in biology, although it has many,
               frequently unappreciated, problems. Most importantly, NHST does
               not provide us with two crucial pieces of information: (1) the
               magnitude of an effect of interest, and (2) the precision of the
               estimate of the magnitude of that effect. All biologists should
               be ultimately interested in biological importance, which may be
               assessed using the magnitude of an effect, but not its
               statistical significance. Therefore, we advocate presentation of
               measures of the magnitude of effects (i.e. effect size
               statistics) and their confidence intervals (CIs) in all
               biological journals. Combined use of an effect size and its CIs
               enables one to assess the relationships within data more
               effectively than the use of p values, regardless of statistical
               significance. In addition, routine presentation of effect sizes
               will encourage researchers to view their results in the context
               of previous research and facilitate the incorporation of results
               into future meta-analysis, which has been increasingly used as
               the standard method of quantitative review in biology. In this
               article, we extensively discuss two dimensionless (and thus
               standardised) classes of effect size statistics: d statistics
               (standardised mean difference) and r statistics (correlation
               coefficient), because these can be calculated from almost all
               study designs and also because their calculations are essential
               for meta-analysis. However, our focus on these standardised
               effect size statistics does not mean unstandardised effect size
               statistics (e.g. mean difference and regression coefficient) are
               less important. We provide potential solutions for four main
               technical problems researchers may encounter when calculating
               effect size and CIs: (1) when covariates exist, (2) when bias in
               estimating effect size is possible, (3) when data have
               non-normal error structure and/or variances, and (4) when data
               are non-independent. Although interpretations of effect sizes
               are often difficult, we provide some pointers to help
               researchers. This paper serves both as a beginner's instruction

               accommodates the presence of undesirable nonperforming
               loans---an inherent characteristic of the bank's production due
               to its exposure to credit risk. Specifically, we model
               nonperforming loans as an undesirable output in the bank's
               production process. Since the stochastic DTDF describing banking
               technology is likely to suffer from the endogeneity of inputs,
               we propose addressing this problem by considering a system
               consisting of the DTDF and the first-order conditions from the
               bank's cost minimization problem. The first-order conditions
               also allow us to identify the `cost-optimal' directional vector

               associated with an ad hoc choice of the direction. We apply our
               cost system approach to the data on large US commercial banks
               for the 2001--2010 period, which we estimate via Bayesian Markov

               wealthy, these private investments have now attracted a much
               broader following that includes pension funds and retail

               shrouded in secrecy, they have developed a mystique and allure

              management can complement each other in order to enhance the
              management of an enterprise. Often, we see that risk management
              focuses on goal achievements and not the enterprise risk related
              to its activities in the value chain. The statement ``no goal, no
              risk'' is a common misconception. The main aim of the article is
              to present a normative model for describing the links between
              performance and risk, and to use this model to give
              recommendations on how to best structure and plan the management
              of an enterprise in situations involving risk and uncertainties.
              The model, which has several novel features, is based on the
              interaction between different types of risk management
              (enterprise risk management, task risk management, and personal
              risk management) and a structure where the enterprise risk
              management overrules both the task and personal risk management.
              To illustrate the model we use the metaphor of a ship, where the
              ship is loaded with cash-generating activities and has a
              direction over time determined by the overall strategic
              objectives. Compared to the current enterprise risk management
              practice, the model and related analysis are founded on a new

               distinctive processes (ways of coordinating and combining),
               shaped by the firm's (specific) asset positions (such as the
               firm's portfolio of difficult-to-trade knowledge assets and
               complementary assets), and the evolution path(s) it has adopted
               or inherited. The importance of path dependencies is amplified
               where conditions of increasing returns exist. Whether and how a
               firm's competitive advantage is eroded depends on the stability
               of market demand, and the ease of replicability (expanding
               internally) and imitatability (replication by competitors). If

  abstract = "This paper provides evidence on how the new international
              regulation on Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs)
              impacts the market value of large banks. We analyze the stock
              price reactions for the 300 largest banks from 52 countries
              across 12 relevant regulatory announcement and designation
              events. We observe that the new regulation negatively affects the
              value of the newly regulated banks, yet that the official
              designation of banks as ``globally systemically important''
              itself has a partly offsetting positive impact. A cross-sectional
              analysis of the valuation effects with respect to, for example,
              government ownership of banks supports the view that the positive
              reaction to these designations can be attributed to a
              Too-Big-to-Fail (TBTF) perception by investors. The fact that
              these valuation effects emerge from a regulation specifically
              designed to reduce the costs and risks of Too-Big-to-Fail
              demonstrates the inherently paradoxical nature of the new
              regulation. These results further suggest that even though the
              individual components of the regulation have been effective,
              revealing the identities of G-SIBs eliminated ambiguity about the
              presence of government guarantees, and thereby may have run
              counter to the regulators' intent to contain the effects of TBTF.",

              is to exploit the mean-reverting properties of prices reported in

              using a return-based factor model, a much larger number of lags
              would be needed, leading to inaccurate parameter estimation. To
              empirically test the relative performance of return-based and

              long-only, and equally weighted) based on the forecasts generated
              by two dynamic factor models. Using the stock of companies
              included in the S\&P 500 index for constructing portfolios, the

              arbitrage. We attribute this finding to the mean-reverting

               recent years by unprecedented consolidation and cross-border
               activities. However, international consolidation has been
               considerably less than might have been expected in developed
               nations---such as long-term members of the EU---where barriers
               to entry have been significantly lowered. In contrast,
               foreign-owned banks have generally achieved much higher
               penetration in developing nations. We investigate the extent to
               which these differences may be related to bank efficiency
               concerns by reviewing and critiquing over 100 studies that
               compare bank efficiencies across nations. The studies are in
               three distinct categories: (1) comparisons of bank efficiencies
               in different nations based on the use of a common efficient
               frontier, (2) comparisons of bank efficiencies in different
               nations using nation-specific frontiers, and (3) comparisons of
               efficiencies of foreign-owned versus domestically owned banks
               within the same nation using the same nation-specific frontier.
               The research---particularly the findings in the third
               category---is generally consistent with the hypothesis that
               efficiency differences help to explain the consolidation
               patterns. The efficiency disadvantages of foreign-owned banks
               relative to domestically owned banks tend to outweigh the
               efficiency advantages in developed nations on average, and this
               situation is generally reversed in developing nations, with
               notable exceptions to both findings. We also stress the need for
               further research in this area.",

               aspect is the incentive in reducing costs in order to gain in
               competitiveness. The second is associated with their lack of
               knowledge of such markets and/ or acceptance of a higher risk in

               (trade at the onset of the liquidity shock) and a
               delayed-trading equilibrium (trade at the last resort). Using a
               partial adjustment model and an annual data sample of US bank

              available in the current literature. These notions are both based
              on the conditional distribution of a random variable Y given a
              stress event for a random variable X , but they use different
              types of stress events. We derive representations of these
              alternative CoVaR notions in terms of copulas, study their
              general dependence consistency and compare their performance in
              several stochastic models. Our central finding is that
              conditioning on X $\geq$ VaR $\alpha$ ( X ) gives a much better
              response to dependence between X and Y than conditioning on X =
              VaR $\alpha$ ( X ). We prove general results that relate the
              dependence consistency of CoVaR using conditioning on X $\geq$
              VaR $\alpha$ ( X ) to well established results on concordance
              ordering of multivariate distributions or their copulas. These
              results also apply to some other systemic risk measures, such as
              the Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES) and the Systemic Impact
              Index (SII). We provide counterexamples showing that CoVaR based
              on the stress event X = VaR $\alpha$ ( X ) is not dependence
              consistent. In particular, if ( X , Y ) is bivariate normal, then
              CoVaR based on X = VaR $\alpha$ ( X ) is not an increasing
              function of the correlation parameter. Similar issues arise in
              the bivariate t model and in the model with t margins and a
              Gumbel copula. In all these cases, CoVaR based on X $\geq$ VaR
              $\alpha$ ( X ) is an increasing function of the dependence

              quality measures---decreasing spreads, increasing displayed depth
              in the limit order book, and lowering short-term volatility. Our
              findings suggest that given the current market structure for U.S.

              view that AT improves informational efficiency by speeding up
              price discovery, but that it may also impose higher adverse
              selection costs on slower traders. In contrast, the reduction in
              the autocorrelation of returns owes more to the algorithmic

  abstract = "Electricity distribution is a prime example of local monopoly. In
              most countries, the costs of electricity distribution operators
              are regulated by the government. However, the cost regulation may
              create adverse incentives to compromise the quality of service.
              To avoid this, cost regulation is often amended with quality
              incentives. This study applies theory and methods of productivity
              analysis to model the frontier of service quality. A
              semi-nonparametric estimation method is developed, which does not
              assume any particular functional form for the quality frontier,
              but can accommodate stochastic noise and heteroscedasticity. The
              empirical part of our paper examines how underground cabling and
              location affect the interruption costs. As expected, higher
              proportion of underground cabling decreases the level of
              interruption costs. The effects of cabling and location on the
              variance of performance are also considered. Especially the
              location is found to be a significant source of
              heteroscedasticity in the interruption costs. Finally, the
              proposed quality frontier benchmark is compared to the current
              practice of Finnish regulation system. The proposed quality
              frontier is found to provide more meaningful and stable basis for

               segregate and provide a measure of security to the communities
               on the religious divide in Northern Ireland. Whilst they do
               ostensibly achieve this aim, it may well be that these
               structures have the capacity to prevent the restoration of
               normal community interactions and market processes and may also
               be providing their benefits at a high price with regard to
               issues such as house price reduction. Indeed, the effect of
               these structures on surrounding residential property values
               remains somewhat of an unknown quantity. This paper therefore
               measures the effect of proximity to locations with social and
               political conflicts. The paper aims to quantify and measure the
               disamenity implications and costs of artificial barriers (peace
               walls) within the Belfast housing market.
               Design/methodology/approach -- This paper attempts to measure
               the disamenity effect of peace walls on house prices, primarily
               focusing on the effect of distance, calculated using a hedonic
               pricing specification and spatially referenced data. The data
               are derived from 3,836 house sales transactions over a one year
               period in 2011. Findings -- The emerging findings demonstrate
               that a greater negative pricing effect is evident with proximity
               to the peace walls, with the exception of the apartment sector.
               The findings also highlight the complex market pricing structure
               of Belfast and offer insight as how to best classify submarkets.
               Practical implications -- The results of the research are of
               particular interest to property valuers and social policy makers
               in regions with contested space. Originality/value -- Tactile
               barriers scar the urban terrain, formalise ethno-segregation
               across Belfast and have implications for spatial planning in the
               urban environment and housing studies and policy. Such an
               externality may have a pervasive and endogenous effect on house
               prices and the identification of submarkets yet there is
               implicit acceptance of peace lines as de facto standard and a
               dearth of empirical evidence relating to direction and magnitude
               of the location-specific effects of peace walls on house prices

               employs a sample of 109 European football clubs for a seven-year
               period, 2008?2014 (three years before and four years after the
               regulatory intervention), to investigate the impact of the
               reform upon management practices related to accounting.
               Following prior literature, we employ the three most commonly
               used proxies of accounting quality: earnings management,
               conditional accounting conservatism and auditor
               switching.Results and findings: This study demonstrates that, at
               the expense of accounting quality, club management seeks to
               promote the image of a financially robust organization in order
               to secure licensing and, consequently, much needed funding from
               UEFA. In this manner, the dominance of a management culture
               which impairs financial performance is further
               cemented.Implications: UEFA should take into consideration that,
               in a financially distressed industry focused on achieving
               success on the field of play, the imposition of regulatory
               monitoring tied to accounting data inevitably leads to a loss of
               organizational credibility and transparency. Hence, UEFA?s
               intervention should be accompanied by the imposition of a
               corporate governance framework which would aim to rearrange club
               management priorities by facilitating a change in
               institutionalized mentalities.",

               proposed for testing the homogeneity of samples. Their
               asymptotic null distributions are derived for the continuous as
               well as the discrete case. In the continuous case the asymptotic
               distributions coincide with the (k - 1)-fold convolution of the
               asymptotic distribution for the Anderson-Darling one-sample
               statistic. The quality of this large sample approximation is
               investigated for small samples through Monte Carlo simulation.
               This is done for both versions of the statistic under various
               degrees of data rounding and sample size imbalances. Tables for
               carrying out these tests are provided, and their usage in
               combining independent one- or k-sample Anderson-Darling tests is
               pointed out. The test statistics are essentially based on a
               doubly weighted sum of integrated squared differences between
               the empirical distribution functions of the individual samples
               and that of the pooled sample. One weighting adjusts for the
               possibly different sample sizes, and the other is inside the
               integration placing more weight on tail differences of the
               compared distributions. The two versions differ mainly in the
               definition of the empirical distribution function. These tests
               are consistent against all alternatives. The use of these tests
               is two-fold: (a) in a one-way analysis of variance to establish
               differences in the sampled populations without making any
               restrictive parametric assumptions or (b) to justify the pooling
               of separate samples for increased sample size and power in
               further analyses. Exact finite sample mean and variance formulas
               for one of the two statistics are derived in the continuous
               case. It appears that the asymptotic standardized percentiles
               serve well as approximate critical points of the appropriately
               standardized statistics for individual sample sizes as low as 5.
               The application of the tests is illustrated with an example.
               Because of the convolution nature of the asymptotic
               distribution, a further use of these critical points is possible
               in combining independent Anderson-Darling tests by simply adding
               their test statistics.",

               In spite of its appealing special structure in allowing for the
               simultaneous and equiproportionate reduction in inputs and
               increase in outputs, HDF is a non-linear optimization and it is

               puzzle that exchange rate models cannot outperform the random

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: When unaccounted-for group-level characteristics
              affect an outcome variable, traditional linear regression is
              inefficient and can be biased. The random- and fixed-effects
              estimators (RE and FE, respectively) are two competing methods
              that address these problems. While each estimator controls for
              otherwise unaccounted-for effects, the two estimators require
              different assumptions. Health researchers tend to favor RE
              estimation, while researchers from some other disciplines tend to
              favor FE estimation. In addition to RE and FE, an alternative
              method called within-between (WB) was suggested by Mundlak in
              1978, although is utilized infrequently. METHODS: We conduct a
              simulation study to compare RE, FE, and WB estimation across
              16,200 scenarios. The scenarios vary in the number of groups, the
              size of the groups, within-group variation, goodness-of-fit of
              the model, and the degree to which the model is correctly
              specified. Estimator preference is determined by lowest mean
              squared error of the estimated marginal effect and root mean
              squared error of fitted values. RESULTS: Although there are
              scenarios when each estimator is most appropriate, the cases in
              which traditional RE estimation is preferred are less common. In
              finite samples, the WB approach outperforms both traditional
              estimators. The Hausman test guides the practitioner to the
              estimator with the smallest absolute error only 61\% of the time,
              and in many sample sizes simply applying the WB approach produces
              smaller absolute errors than following the suggestion of the
              test. CONCLUSIONS: Specification and estimation should be
              carefully considered and ultimately guided by the objective of
              the analysis and characteristics of the data. The WB approach has
              been underutilized, particularly for inference on marginal
              effects in small samples. Blindly applying any estimator can lead
              to bias, inefficiency, and flawed inference.",

               developed for demeaned data, but the statistics have the same
               limiting distributions when applied to regression residuals.
               Monte Carlo simulations show that the test statistics for
               symmetry and normality have good finite-sample size and power.
               However, size distortions render testing for kurtosis almost
               meaningless except for distributions with thin tails, such as
               the normal distribution. Combining skewness and kurtosis is
               still a useful test of normality provided that the limiting
               variance accounts for the serial correlation in the data. The
               tests are applied to 21 macroeconomic time series.",

               issues related to the limiting distribution of estimators and
               test statistics in the linear model with multiple structural
               changes. In this companion paper, we consider practical issues
               for the empirical applications of the procedures. We first
               address the problem of estimation of the break dates and present
               an efficient algorithm to obtain global minimizers of the sum of
               squared residuals. This algorithm is based on the principle of
               dynamic programming and requires at most least-squares
               operations of order O(T2) for any number of breaks. Our method
               can be applied to both pure and partial structural change
               models. Second, we consider the problem of forming confidence
               intervals for the break dates under various hypotheses about the
               structure of the data and the errors across segments. Third, we
               address the issue of testing for structural changes under very
               general conditions on the data and the errors. Fourth, we

                   common breaks across or within equations of a multivariate
                   system. Our framework is very general and allows integrated
                   regressors and trends as well as stationary regressors. The
                   null hypothesis is that breaks in different parameters
                   (either regression coefficients or elements of the
                   covariance matrix of the errors) occur at a common locations
                   or are separated by some positive fraction of the sample
                   size. Under the alternative hypothesis, the break dates are
                   not the same and also need not be separated by a positive
                   fraction of the sample size across parameters. The test

               to implement those principles. We document how the rise of
               shadow banking was helped by regulatory and legal changes that
               gave advantages to three main institutions: money-market mutual
               funds (MMMFs) to capture retail deposits from traditional banks,
               securitization to move assets of traditional banks off their
               balance sheets, and repurchase agreements (repos) that
               facilitated the use of securitized bonds as money. The evolution
               of a bankruptcy safe harbor for repos was crucial to the growth
               and efficiency of shadow banking; regulators can use access to
               this safe harbor as the lever to enforce new rules. History has
               demonstrated two successful methods for regulating privately
               created money: strict guidelines on collateral, and
               government-guaranteed insurance. We propose the use of insurance

               both securitization and repos, with regulatory control
               established by chartering new forms of narrow banks for MMMFs

               this disturbance term is not transmitted to inputs, that is, if
               inputs are independent of this disturbance, then the least
               squares estimator is consistent; if the disturbance is fully
               transmitted to inputs, then a consistent estimator is obtained
               if some restrictions are imposed on the second moments of the
               disturbances in the system. A more general case may be
               specified, however, encompassing the above specifications as
               subcases. In this general case, the disturbance term may be only
               partially transmitted. If this occurs, then neither of the

              during the pre-crisis and post-crisis periods, both in terms of
              technical and allocative efficiencies. We use an innovative
              Bayesian dynamic frontier model that: (1) distinguishes between
              short-run and long-run performance; and (2) provides impulse
              response functions to examine the dynamic effect of shocks in
              technical and allocative inefficiencies. Based on a rich sample
              of European banks, we show that while there was a drop in
              efficiency for most countries following the crisis, the long-run
              results suggest improvement both in terms of technical and
              allocative efficiencies. The impulse response functions also show
              that in the case of shocks in the system, banks seem to revert
              back to these long-run allocative efficiency scores. We discuss
              the results in terms of the current financial crisis and provide
              interesting implications for the European banking industry. We

               Missile crisis, the assassination of JFK, the OPEC I oil-price

               structural framework to analyze the impact of these uncertainty
               shocks. I build a model with a time-varying second moment, which
               is numerically solved and estimated using firm-level data. The
               parameterized model is then used to simulate a macro uncertainty
               shock, which produces a rapid drop and rebound in aggregate
               output and employment. This occurs because higher uncertainty
               causes firms to temporarily pause their investment and hiring.
               Productivity growth also falls because this pause in activity
               freezes reallocation across units. In the medium term the
               increased volatility from the shock induces an overshoot in
               output, employment, and productivity. Thus, uncertainty shocks
               generate short sharp recessions and recoveries. This simulated
               impact of an uncertainty shock is compared to vector

               While there is no evidence that causality runs from payroll to
               performance over the entire sample period, the data shows that
               the cross section correlation between payroll and performance

  abstract  = "Productivity measurement has not generally been considered part
               of the information that managers use in planning and control
               decisions. Kaplan (1983) criticizes accounting research for the
               lack of studies on production efficiency stating that the
               effects of output volume and substitution possibilities among
               key production inputs on productivity measures have not been the
               subject of any accounting research. Hasseldine (1967), Mensah
               (1982), and Marcinko and Petri (1984) have addressed the
               short-comings of traditional financial measures of productive
               efficiency. Barlev and Callen (1986) show that input standards
               should not be defined independent of input prices, the state of
               technology, and the level of output. These authors, however,
               provide no empirical applications. This study provides empirical
               evidence related to performance measures of efficiency of
               production. Traditional budgeting methods and measures used for
               analysis may provide inadequate information for effective
               performance evaluation and control monitoring. This is
               particularly true if the budget model assumes that input cost
               shares are fixed. Analytical methods including budget analysis
               that fail to consider available input substitution possibilities
               in response to changes in relative input prices, and methods
               that fail to consider changes in operating conditions, may
               result in lost opportunities for cost savings. For example,
               traditional methods of assigning responsibility for accounting
               variances tend to focus attention on meeting the budget and may
               divert attention from production input-mix decisions when
               relative input prices change. For this study, we obtained data
               on the output produced and the input consumed via on-site visits
               to 33 county correctional institutions (jails) in Tennessee. A
               multivariate regression system of simultaneous equations and a
               translog cost function specification were employed to analyze
               these data. Our empirical model specification required input
               prices, output levels, and the state of technology as
               independent variables (not summary financial measures) to
               explain total operating expenditures for the budget period.
               Agency theory provides a means for inferring managerial
               behavior. The translog cost function coefficients provide
               essential information about variability in input cost shares for
               the sample data. Based on the hypotheses tested, we rejected the
               reasonableness of the conventional budget model assumption of
               fixed cost shares. We provide empirical evidence that managerial
               decisions based on matching expenditures and appropriations in
               line item budgets may not be cost-minimizing. The evidence
               suggests that a translog budget model may produce additional
               useful performance evaluation and control monitoring information
               that is not available from budget models which assume that
               cost-minimizing input cost (budget) shares are fixed.",

              a hybrid measure, which combines the Too Interconnected To Fail

              available daily data and encompasses the popular Marginal ES

              systemic risk at a precise date but also to forecast its
              contribution over a certain period. The empirical application
              verifies the ability of CES to identify the most systemically
              risky firms during the 2007--2009 financial crisis. We show that

               reduced-form long-run relationship between investment and output
               (rather than between the capital stock and output). In this
               paper, a new investment equation is estimated in the full
               structural framework, exploiting a measure of the capital stock
               constructed by the Bank, and a long series for the cost of
               capital. A constant elasticity of substitution production
               function is assumed, and a well-determined estimate of the
               elasticity of substitution is obtained by a variety of measures.
               The robust result is that the elasticity of substitution is
               significantly different from unity (the Cobb--Douglas case), at
               about 0.45. Overidentifying restrictions on the long-run
               relationship are all accepted. Thus there is strong evidence for
               a significant effect from the user cost of capital.",

               micro loan market could offer certain benefits to both borrowers

               the popular online P2P lending houses, this article explores the
               P2P loan characteristics, evaluates their credit risk and

               debt-to-income ratio, FICO score and revolving line utilization
               play an important role in loan defaults. Loans with lower credit
               grade and longer duration are associated with high mortality
               rate. The result is consistent with the Cox Proportional Hazard
               test which suggests that the hazard rate or the likelihood of
               the loan default increases with the credit risk of the
               borrowers. Finally, we find that higher interest rates charged
               on the high-risk borrowers are not enough to compensate for
               higher probability of the loan default. The Lending Club must

              institutions, which are experts in dealing with this risk. P2P
              lenders suffer a severe problem of information asymmetry, because
              they are at a disadvantage facing the borrower. For this reason,

              heuristic that relies substantially on the advisor's
              communication style when deciding how much to trust and delegate
              investment decisions. Portfolio decisions appear to depend more

              relationship than on the risk and return characteristics of
              investments comprising the portfolio choice set. This evidence
              supports Pentland's (2008) ``honest signals'' as a more powerful
              mechanism underlying investor trust than standard metrics based

              trusting based on simple honest signals, although vulnerable to
              exploitation, can be interpreted as ecologically rational.
              Features of the investor's environment typical of non-profit

  abstract = "Over the last 35 years, business failure prediction has become a
              major research domain within corporate finance. Numerous
              corporate failure prediction models have been developed, based on
              various modelling techniques. The most popular are the classic
              cross-sectional statistical methods, which have resulted in
              various `single-period' or static models, especially multivariate
              discriminant models and logit models. To date, there has been no
              clear overview and discussion of the application of classic
              statistical methods to business failure prediction. Therefore,
              this paper extensively elaborates on the application of (1)
              univariate analysis, (2) risk index models, (3) multivariate
              discriminant analysis, and (4) conditional probability models in
              corporate failure prediction. In addition, because there is no
              clear and comprehensive analysis in the existing literature of
              the diverse problems related to the application of these methods
              to the topic of corporate failure prediction, this paper brings
              together all problem issues and enlarges upon each of them. It
              discusses all problems related to: (1) the classical paradigm
              (i.e. the arbitrary definition of failure, non-stationarity and
              data instability, sampling selectivity, and the choice of the
              optimisation criteria); (2) the neglect of the time dimension of
              failure; and (3) the application focus in failure prediction
              modelling. Further, the paper elaborates on a number of other
              problems related to the use of a linear classification rule, the
              use of annual account information, and neglect of the
              multidimensional nature of failure. This paper contributes
              towards a thorough understanding of the features of the classic

              problem that encompasses both problems. Likewise, quantile
              regression offers an extension of univariate quantile estimation
              to estimation of conditional quantile functions via an
              optimization of a piecewise linear objective function in the

              The asymptotic theory of quantile regression closely parallels
              the theory of the univariate sample quantiles. Computation of

               stock return correlations and default correlations among the 22
               largest bank holding companies and investment banks from 1988 to
               2008, we find that daily stock return correlation is a simple,
               robust, forward-looking, and timely systemic risk indicator.
               There is an increasing trend in stock return correlation among
               banks, whereas there is no obvious correlation trend among
               non-banks. We also disaggregate the stock returns into
               systematic and idiosyncratic components and find that the
               correlation increases are largely driven by the increases in
               correlations between banks' idiosyncratic risks, which give rise
               to increasing systemic risk. Correlation spikes tend to predict
               or coincide with significant economic or market events,
               especially during the 2007--2008 financial crisis. Furthermore,
               we show that stock return correlations offer a perspective on

               OLS to compute the DD estimate of its ``effect'' as well as the
               standard error of this estimate. These conventional DD standard
               errors severely understate the standard deviation of the
               estimators: we find an ``effect'' significant at the 5 percent
               level for up to 45 percent of the placebo interventions. We use
               Monte Carlo simulations to investigate how well existing methods
               help solve this problem. Econometric corrections that place a
               specific parametric form on the time-series process do not
               perform well. Bootstrap (taking into account the autocorrelation
               of the data) works well when the number of states is large
               enough. Two corrections based on asymptotic approximation of the
               variance-covariance matrix work well for moderate numbers of
               states and one correction that collapses the time series
               information into a ``pre''- and ``post''-period and explicitly
               takes into account the effective sample size works well even for
               small numbers of states.",

                 most extreme, produce the classic shape of an asset bubble. In

                 and discuss theories that can potentially explain events like
                 the boom-bust cycles of the 2000s. One set of theories assumes
                 rationality and uses idiosyncratic features of the housing

                 constraints, to explain the stylized facts. Cheap credit

                 booms, but temporary periods of low interest rates will not

               been augmented with exchange rates, asset prices, credit or
               leverage, and spreads. In addition, the chapter compares the

               of the Eurozone from 1999 (with the introduction of the euro)
               until 2013. Chapter 2 goes on to investigate the funding
               advantage that is provided to German Landesbanken by the joint
               liability scheme of the German Savings Banks Finance Group.
               Chapter 3 investigates peer-to-peer (P2P) lending and shows that
               the changing role of soft information, online platform default
               risk, liquidity risk and underdeveloped online secondary

  abstract = "Six years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the question of
              whether the U.S. financial system has become less risky remains
              unanswered. On the one side, new regulations including Dodd-Frank
              and Basel III have made improvements by requiring higher bank
              capital, and financial institutions themselves have reduced
              risk-taking activities. On the other side, it has been argued
              that ``the fundamental risks remained and the efforts of
              regulators and politicians were simply rearranging the deckchairs
              on the Titanic.'' (Baily and Elliott, 2013) This paper highlights
              the changing nature of financial institution risk from 2005 to
              2011. It finds that while these institutions have become less
              risky individually after the crisis, the financial market has
              become more vulnerable to systemic contagion. The causal
              inference that the crisis and the post-crisis legislation have
              gradually changed the nature of financial institution risk is
              drawn from a quasi-experimental design. This finding suggests
              that the ever more integrated financial system might experience
              more synchronized contractions in future crises, providing

              For individual time series, the efficiency and reliability of

               a long lasting impact on the structure of European banking and
               explore the regulatory architecture that has started to take
               form in their wake. Academic experts and senior policy makers
               have contributed to this volume, which is organized in five main
               parts. The first part presents an overview of European banking
               through the crisis and beyond. The second part analyses
               performance and innovation in EU banking markets. The third part
               discusses the key regulatory changes aimed at fostering
               financial stability. Part four looks at the relevance of
               cross-border banking and part five presents a detailed analysis
               of the main EU banking markets. This is a highly informative and
               carefully presented handbook, which provides thought-provoking
               insights into the past, present and future landscapes of
               European banking. It will appeal to a wide readership, from
               scholars and students, through to researchers, practitioners and
               policy-makers.",

               associated with greater risk of failure. But in 1977-83, when

              unions using a latent class approach to measure structural
              performance over the period 2002 to 2013. The latent class
              approach allows the endogenous identification of a multi-class
              framework for business models based on credit union specific
              characteristics. The analysis finds a three class system to be
              appropriate with the multi-class model dependent on three
              financial viability characteristics. This finding is consistent
              with the deliberations of the Irish Commission on Credit Unions
              (2012) which identified complexity and diversity in the business
              models of Irish credit unions and recommended that such
              complexity and diversity could not be accommodated within a one

              This may suggest credit unions would benefit from a reduction in
              scale or perhaps that there is an imbalance in the present change
              process. Finally, relative performance differences are identified
              for each class in terms of technical efficiency. This suggests

                   2010, it took just five minutes for a spontaneous mix of
                   human and machine interactions in the global trading
                   cyberspace to generate an unprecedented system-wide Flash

                   crucial sub-second regime where humans become unable to
                   respond or intervene sufficiently quickly. Here we analyze a
                   set of 18,520 ultrafast black swan events that we have
                   uncovered in stock-price movements between 2006 and 2011. We
                   provide empirical evidence for, and an accompanying theory
                   of, an abrupt system-wide transition from a mixed
                   human-machine phase to a new all-machine phase characterized
                   by frequent black swan events with ultrafast durations
                   (<650ms for crashes, <950ms for spikes). Our theory
                   quantifies the systemic fluctuations in these two distinct
                   phases in terms of the diversity of the system's internal
                   ecology and the amount of global information being

                   relationship between these ultrafast 'fractures' and the
                   slow 'breaking' of the global financial system post-2006.

               find that bank efficiency has been undermined by the financial

               higher efficiency levels. Nonetheless, a noticeable catching up
               process is observed for banks from the ?new? EU countries.
               Consequently, we do not find evidence of group convergence for
               bank productivity but there is evidence of convergence in bank
               efficiency change and technical change among the EU28 countries

               general contribution to the use of deep learning for stochastic

               trading strategies used by our algorithm is large enough to

  abstract = "We find that regulators can implement identical rules
              inconsistently due to differences in their institutional design
              and incentives, and this behavior may adversely impact the
              effectiveness with which regulation is implemented. We study
              supervisory decisions of U.S. banking regulators and exploit a
              legally determined rotation policy that assigns federal and state
              supervisors to the same bank at exogenously set time intervals.
              Comparing federal and state regulator supervisory ratings within
              the same bank, we find that federal regulators are systematically
              tougher, downgrading supervisory ratings almost twice as
              frequently as do state supervisors. State regulators counteract
              these downgrades to some degree by upgrading more frequently.
              Under federal regulators, banks report worse asset quality,
              higher regulatory capital ratios, and lower return on assets.
              Leniency of state regulators relative to their federal
              counterparts is related to costly outcomes, such as higher
              failure rates and lower repayment rates of government assistance
              funds. The discrepancy in regulator behavior is related to
              different weights given by regulators to local economic

  abstract = "The aim of this paper is to contribute to the debate on systemic
              risk by assessing the extent to which distress within the main
              different financial sectors, namely, the banking, insurance and
              other financial services industries contribute to systemic risk.
              To this end, we rely on the $\Delta$CoVaR systemic risk measure
              introduced by Adrian and Brunnermeier (2011). In order to provide
              a formal ranking of the financial sectors with respect to their
              contribution to systemic risk, the original $\Delta$CoVaR
              approach is extended here to include the Kolmogorov--Smirnov test
              developed by Abadie (2002), based on bootstrapping. Our empirical
              results reveal that in the Eurozone, for the period ranging from
              2004 to 2012, the other financial services sector contributes
              relatively the most to systemic risk at times of distress
              affecting this sector. In turn, the banking sector appears to
              contribute more to systemic risk than the insurance sector. By
              contrast, the insurance industry is the systemically riskiest
              financial sector in the United States for the same period, while
              the banking sector contributes the least to systemic risk in this
              area. Beyond this ranking, the three financial sectors of
              interest are found to contribute significantly to systemic risk,

              using the internet, without standard financial intermediaries.
              Drawing on a dataset of over 48,500 projects with combined
              funding over \$237M, this paper offers a description of the
              underlying dynamics of success and failure among crowdfunded
              ventures. It suggests that personal networks and underlying
              project quality are associated with the success of crowdfunding
              efforts, and that geography is related to both the type of
              projects proposed and successful fundraising. Finally, I find
              that the vast majority of founders seem to fulfill their
              obligations to funders, but that over 75\% deliver products later
              than expected, with the degree of delay predicted by the level

  abstract  = "Demonstrating compelling causal evidence of the existence and
               strength of peer-to-peer influence has become the holy grail of
               modern research in online social networks. In these networks, it
               has been consistently demonstrated that user characteristics and
               behavior tend to cluster both in space and in time. There are
               multiple well-known rival mechanisms that compete to be the
               explanation for this observed clustering. These range from peer
               influence to homophily to other unobservable external stimuli.
               These multiple mechanisms lead to similar observational data,
               yet have vastly different policy implications. In this paper, we
               present a novel randomized experiment that tests the existence
               of causal peer influence in the general population?one that did
               not involve subject recruitment for experimentation?of a
               particular large-scale online social network. We utilize a
               unique social feature to exogenously induce adoption of a paid
               service among a group of randomly selected users, and in the
               process develop a clean exogenous randomization of treatment and
               control groups. A variety of nonparametric, semiparametric, and
               parametric approaches, ranging from resampling-based inference
               to ego-level random effects to logistic regression to survival
               models, yield close to identical, statistically and economically
               significant estimates of peer influence in the general
               population of a freemium social network. Our estimates show that
               peer influence causes more than a 60\% increase in odds of
               buying the service due to the influence coming from an adopting
               friend. In addition, we find that users with a smaller number of
               friends experience stronger relative increase in the adoption
               likelihood due to influence from their peers as compared to the
               users with a larger number of friends. Our nonparametric
               resampling procedure-based estimates are helpful in situations
               of networked data that violate independence assumptions. We
               establish that peer influence is a powerful force in getting
               users from free to premium levels, a known challenge in freemium

               defaults of commercial banks occurred in the United States
               between 2007 and 2009. The results highlight that structural
               funding position indeed plays a significant role in explaining
               the probability of bank defaults. A balanced funding position,
               with more deposits and a lower loans-deposits gap to be filled
               with wholesale funding, positively contributes to the resilience
               of the banks. Not all deposits are, however, the same: within

               components the more likely a bank is to face distress. Results

  abstract  = "The Japanese banking system provides a distinctive platform for
               the examination of the long-lasting effect of problem loans on
               bank performance. Japan is also known for an extended
               quantitative easing programme of unprecedented scale. Yet the
               links between risk-taking activities, quantitative easing, and
               bank competition are largely unexplored. This thesis employs a
               unique database, which allows us to distinguish between bankrupt
               and restructured loans. The aim of the thesis is to investigate
               the impact of these loans on Japanese bank efficiency and
               productivity growth, as well as their relationship with bank
               competition and quantitative easing policy. We measure technical
               efficiency by modifying a translog enhanced hyperbolic distance
               function with two undesirable outputs, identified as problem
               loans and problem other earning assets. Further analyses reveal
               that bankrupt loans affect efficiency in a manner related to the
               ``moral hazard, skimping'' hypothesis, with the causality
               originating from bankrupt loans. In contrast, the relationship
               between restructured loans and efficiency supports the ``bad
               luck'' hypothesis. We also follow the parametric approach to
               quantify the impact of bankrupt and restructured loans on
               productivity growth of the Japanese banking system. We further
               perform convergence cluster analysis to examine convergence in
               productivity growth between regions, where limited convergence
               is reported. Additionally, this thesis employs, for the first
               time, the bank-level Boone indicator to measure bank competition
               in Japan to examine the underlying linkages between quantitative
               easing, competition, and risk. Given the scale of problem loans,
               we measure bank risk-taking based on bankrupt and restructured
               loans. Our analyses show that enhancing quantitative easing and
               competition would reduce bankrupt and restructured loans, but it
               would negatively affect financial stability. In light of the
               ongoing negative interest rates and quantitative and qualitative
               easing policy to enhance economic growth in Japan, this thesis
               would provide insightful implications for policymakers and

                 when markets are frozen, i.e. when investors refuse to fund
                 banks in the absence of balance sheet information. Even then,
                 intervention is only warranted if there is sufficient
                 contagion across banks, in a sense we make precise within our

              Using a unique dataset of bank share prices from 1830 to 2010 to
              assess the stability of the UK banking system, we find that
              banking instability has grown more severe since the 1970s. We
              also find that interest rates, inflation, lending growth, and

              Examining the impact of the institutional and regulatory

              more fragile in countries with weak supervision and private

              that in a world of too-big-to-fail policy, simple equity-linked

              interest rates can incentivise the executive to make socially
              optimal risk choices, but only if they are accompanied by
              appropriate restrictions on the curvature of pay with respect to

  abstract = "This paper examines money creation process of the banking system
              when it is complying with the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). A
              stock-flow based dynamic model of credit creation process is
              developed in which the commercial bank supplies loans to the
              firm. The change of credit is governed by the bank lending and
              the repayment of the existing loans, where the equilibrium stock
              of credit could be attained once the lending is exactly equal to
              the repayment. However, the supply of bank loans is restricted by
              both the reserve requirement set by the central bank and the LCR
              prescribed by the banking authority; and, as a result, money
              creation must be affected by all these regulations. The bank loan
              supply under the constraint of the required liquidity buffer
              might have different prescriptions under different economic
              scenarios, and would eventually result in an equilibrium monetary
              stock correspondingly. The final formula of money multiplier is
              derived respectively as the rational response of the bank to the
              corresponding regulation. When the reserve requirement is tighter
              than the LCR, the money multiplier has the same expression of
              that in the prevailing fractional reserve regime. Yet when the
              situation departs from this regime, the determinants of the money
              multiplier are found to be associated with the parameters that
              characterize the behavior of banks subject to the regulation and
              of the private sector rather than those monetary structural
              factors. It is noteworthy that there may be a credit contraction
              and even a significant reduction in money multiplier when the
              bank is regulated by the LCR. This novel perspective on credit
              creation of the banking system also offers us an insightful
              understanding on the impacts of banking regulations on the
              stability of the banking system and suggests a new guide tool for

              covering the period from 2000:Q1 to 2013:Q4, with tightenings and

              more actively after the global financial crisis in both advanced

              targeted the housing sector, especially in the advanced
              economies. (3) Macroprudential policies are usually changed in
              tandem with bank reserve requirements, capital flow restrictions,
              and monetary policy. (4) Our analysis suggests that
              macroprudential tightening is associated with lower bank credit

              Targeted policies -- for example, those specifically intended to

               regression decomposes fund underperformance into characteristics
               (including fund and management attributes), managerial
               inefficiency, and statistical noise. In the third stage, DEA
               with slack-adjusted data is used to find out the pure
               performance. It is found that a fund's performance significantly

               underperformed newly chartered traditional banks mainly because
               of their higher overhead costs. European banks have not been an
               exception in this regard. This paper analyses, for the first
               time in Europe, whether this is a temporary phenomenon and
               whether Internet banks may generate scale economies in excess of
               those available to traditional banks. Also do they (and their
               customers) accumulate experience with this new business model,
               allowing them to perform as well or even better than their
               peers, the traditional banks? To this end, we have generally
               followed the same analytical framework and methodology used by
               DeYoung (2001, 2002, 2005) for Internet banks in the USA
               although the limitations in the availability of data, as well as
               the existence of different regulatory frameworks and market
               conditions, particularly in the retail segment, in the 15
               European Union countries have required some modifications to the
               methodology. The empirical analysis confirms that, as is the
               case for US banks, European Internet banks show technologically
               based scale economies, while no conclusive evidence exists of
               technology based learning economies. As Internet banks get
               larger, the profitability gap with traditional banks shrinks. To
               the extent that Internet banks are profitable, European
               authorities may encourage a larger number of consumers to use
               this delivery channel, by tackling consumers security concerns.
               This would allow Internet banks to capture more of the potential
               scale efficiencies implied in our estimations. [ABSTRACT FROM

              consumer debt and household net worth among credit union members

              no role to play. This result adds to a recent US-based

                 governance mechanism for addressing agency problems inherent
                 to many organizations. Formal theory on boards of directors
                 has been quite limited to this point. Most empirical work on
                 boards has been aimed at answering one of three questions: 1)
                 How are board characteristics such as composition or size
                 related to profitability? 2) How do board characteristics
                 affect the observable actions of the board? 3) What factors
                 affect the makeup of boards and how they evolve over time? The
                 primary findings from the empirical literature on boards are:
                 Board composition is not related to corporate performance,
                 while board size has a negative relation to corporate
                 performance. Both board composition and size are correlated

                 acquisitions, poison pills, and executive compensation.
                 Finally, boards appear to evolve over time as a function of
                 the bargaining power of the CEO relative to the existing
                 directors. Firm performance, CEO turnover, and changes in

              of cross-variable shrinkage; and assess rolling versus recursive
              estimation. Finally, we analyze the robustness of the results to
              the VAR size and composition (using also data for France, Canada
              and the UK, while the main analysis is for the USA). We obtain a
              large set of empirical results, but the overall message is that
              we find very small losses (and sometimes even gains) from the
              adoption of specification choices that make BVAR modeling quick
              and easy, in particular for point forecasting. This finding could
              therefore further enhance the diffusion of the BVAR as an
              econometric tool for a vast range of applications. Copyright

              controlling the aggregate supply of credit it must be the case

               assigning a numerical score based on the predictive distribution
               and on the event or value that materializes. A scoring rule is
               proper if the forecaster maximizes the expected score for an
               observation drawn from the distributionF if he or she issues the
               probabilistic forecast F, rather than G ? F. It is strictly
               proper if the maximum is unique. In prediction problems, proper
               scoring rules encourage the forecaster to make careful
               assessments and to be honest. In estimation problems, strictly
               proper scoring rules provide attractive loss and utility
               functions that can be tailored to the problem at hand. This
               article reviews and develops the theory of proper scoring rules
               on general probability spaces, and proposes and discusses
               examples thereof. Proper scoring rules derive from convex
               functions and relate to information measures, entropy functions,
               and Bregman divergences. In the case of categorical variables,
               we prove a rigorous version of the Savage representation.
               Examples of scoring rules for probabilistic forecasts in the
               form of predictive densities include the logarithmic, spherical,
               pseudospherical, and quadratic scores. The continuous ranked
               probability score applies to probabilistic forecasts that take
               the form of predictive cumulative distribution functions. It
               generalizes the absolute error and forms a special case of a new
               and very general type of score, the energy score. Like many
               other scoring rules, the energy score admits a kernel
               representation in terms of negative definite functions, with
               links to inequalities of Hoeffding type, in both univariate and
               multivariate settings. Proper scoring rules for quantile and
               interval forecasts are also discussed. We relate proper scoring
               rules to Bayes factors and to cross-validation, and propose a
               novel form of cross-validation known as random-fold
               cross-validation. A case study on probabilistic weather
               forecasts in the North American Pacific Northwest illustrates
               the importance of propriety. We note optimum score approaches to
               point and quantile estimation, and propose the intuitively

               how ``living wills'' and public disclosure of such resolution
               plans contribute to market discipline and the effective
               resolution of too big and too complex to fail banks.
               Design/methodology/approach -- The disorderly collapse of Lehman
               Brothers is analyzed. Large, systemically important banks are
               now required to prepare resolution plans (living wills). In the
               USA, parts of the living wills must be disclosed to the public.
               The public component is analyzed with respect to contribution to
               market discipline and effective resolution of banks considered
               too big and complex to fail. In a statistical analysis of the
               publicly available section of living wills, this information is
               contrasted with legislative requirements. Findings -- The
               analysis of public disclosures of resolution plans shows that
               they are insufficient to facilitate market discipline and, in
               some instances, fail to enhance public understanding of the
               financial institution and its business. When coupled with the
               uncertainty over how an internationally active financial
               institution will be resolved, the paper concludes that these
               reforms will do little to reduce market expectations that some
               financial firms are simply too big or too complex to fail.
               Research limitations/implications -- A very small data set and
               the necessity of cross-checking the authors' observations with
               all publicly available sources. The authors have also tried to
               infer a purpose for public disclosure of parts of resolution
               plans. The authorities are remarkably vague on the issue and so
               the authors have assumed they actually did have a specific
               intent that would strengthen the system. Practical implications
               -- The inference from the publicly available portion of living
               wills is that the authorities are a very long way from
               abolishing too-big-to-fail. Originality/value -- So far as the

               mergers. The Malmquist index indicates significant technological

               review aimed at understanding the reasons for this variability.
               Surprisingly, although this issue is well-known, it has not been
               systematically analyzed before. In order to fill this gap, we
               perform a Meta-Regression-Analysis (MRA) by examining 1,661
               efficiency scores retrieved from 120 papers published over the
               period 2000-2014. The meta-regression is estimated by using the
               Random Effects Multilevel Model (REML), because it controls for
               within-study and between-study heterogeneity. The analysis
               yields four main results. Firstly, parametric methods yield
               lower levels of banking efficiency than nonparametric studies.
               This holds true even after controlling for the approach used in
               selecting the inputs and outputs of the frontier. Secondly, we
               show that banking efficiency is highest when using the value
               added approach, followed by estimates from studies based on the
               intermediation method, whereas those based on the hybrid
               approach are the lowest. Thirdly, efficiency scores also depend
               on the quality of studies and on the number of observations and
               variables used in the primary papers. As far as the effects of
               sample size, dimension and quality of papers are concerned,
               there are significant differences in sign and magnitude between
               parametric and nonparametric studies. Finally, cost efficiency
               is found to be higher than profit and production efficiency.
               Interestingly, MRA results are robust to the potential outliers

              from the perspective of corporate strategies to adapt a
              regulation change on undesirable outputs. The concept is
              separated into natural and managerial disposability. After
              discussing how to measure the degree of scale efficiency within
              the non-radial approach, this study applies the proposed DEA
              environmental assessment to measure the performance of coal-fired
              power plants in the U.S. north-east region. The region has been
              long producing a large amount of coal from the Appalachian
              Mountains. The coal mining industry has supported U.S. energy
              utility and other industries. Because of the long history, the
              quality of coal became worse and the coal-fired power plants have
              been producing a large amount of undesirable gases. This study
              has statistically confirmed that there is a significant
              difference between the two types (BIT: bituminous coal and SUB:
              subbituminous coal) of coal-fired power plants in terms of their
              unified efficiency measures, including their scale efficiencies,
              under the concept of managerial disposability (the first
              priority: environment performance and the second priority:
              operational performance). In contrast, under the natural
              disposability (the first priority: operational performance and
              the second priority: environmental performance), this study
              cannot find such a statistical significance between them. The
              fact, in which BIT outperforms SUB in terms of their unified and
              scale efficiencies, suggests the policy implication that these
              power plants need to shift their coal combustions from SUB to BIT
              in the United States. Besides the empirical finding, this study
              cannot confirm the other hypothesis on whether coal-fired power
              plants with small operation (less than 50\% in plant capacity
              factor) outperform ones with large operation (more than 50\% in
              plant capacity factor), and vice versa, in terms of their unified
              and scale efficiency measures under natural and managerial
              disposability. An exception is found in environmental performance
              under variable returns to scale. The rationale is because their
              plant operations are frequently monitored by regulatory agencies.
              As a consequence, this study cannot find such a statistical
              difference between them on operational performance. This result
              implies that the regulation on coal-fired power plants has been
              effective on their unified performance but large power plants may
              have a potential to improve their environmental performance.",

               are held in round-robin format. In establishing standings,
               tie-breaker criteria are often required to assign unique ranks
               to competitors that are equal on points. During the 2012 Union
               of European Football Associations (UEFA) European Football
               Championship, the relative ranking of two teams could possibly
               be influenced by a match in which neither team was involved,
               which we refer to as heteronomous relative ranking (HRR). We
               seek to shed light on the origin and the practical relevance of
               HRR in soccer competitions.Research methodsWe trace the
               appearance of HRR back to particularities in the UEFA EURO 2012
               tie-breaker criteria, which favor head-to-head records over goal
               difference, and relate the concept of autonomous relative
               ranking to Arrow's Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives.
               Using historical and Monte?Carlo simulated data, we compare HRR
               occurrence rates under EURO 2012 regulations to those under
               F{\'e}d{\'e}ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA)
               2010 regulations, the latter of which give less importance to
               head-to-head records.Results and findingsHRR is well explained
               by tie-breaker criteria, namely the priorities of head-to-head
               records and goal difference. HRR occurs in more than 10\% of
               four-team soccer groups under EURO 2012 regulations; this rate
               is further increased in round-robin groups of six teams. FIFA
               2010 regulations lead to less than 0.1\%
               HRR.ImplicationsHead-to-head records may result in

                 International Banking Research Network, researchers from

                 prudential policy changes and their effects on bank lending

                 First, the effects of prudential instruments sometimes spill
                 over borders through bank lending. Second, international
                 spillovers vary across prudential instruments and are
                 heterogeneous across banks. Bank-specific factors like balance
                 sheet conditions and business models drive the amplitude and
                 direction of spillovers to lending growth rates. Third, the
                 effects of international spillovers of prudential policy on
                 loan growth rates have not been large on average. However, our

                 other of academic specialists. We find that central banks in
                 crisis countries are more likely to have resorted to new
                 policies, to have had discussions about mandates, and to have
                 communicated more. But the thinking has changed more
                 broadly---for instance, central banks in non-crisis countries
                 also report having implemented macro-prudential measures.
                 Overall, we expect central banks in the future to have broader
                 mandates, use macro-prudential tools more widely, and
                 communicate more actively than before the crisis. While there

                 a particular tool are more likely to assess that tool
                 positively. Finally, the relationship between central banks
                 and their governments might well have changed, with central

              policies---and any possible interactions---been a factor behind
              the recent ``deglobalisation'' in cross-border bank lending? To
              test this hypothesis, we use bank-level data from the UK---a
              country at the heart of the global financial system. Our results
              suggest that increases in microprudential capital requirements
              tend to reduce international bank lending and some forms of
              unconventional monetary policy can amplify this effect.
              Specifically, the UK׳s Funding for Lending Scheme (FLS)
              significantly amplified the effects of increased capital
              requirements on cross-border lending. Quantitative easing did not
              appear to have a similar effect and countries with stronger
              prudential capital regulations were partially insulated against
              the effects of these changes in UK policy. We find that this
              interaction between microprudential regulations and the FLS can
              explain roughly 30\% of the contraction in aggregate UK
              cross-border bank lending between mid-2012 and end-2013,
              corresponding to around 10\% of the global contraction in
              cross-border lending. This suggests that unconventional monetary

               of the fitted model, and the forecasts from it, are generally
               calculated as if the model were known in the first place. This
               is theoretically incorrect, as least squares theory, for
               example, does not apply when the same data are used to
               formulates and fit a model. Ignoring prior model selection leads
               to biases, not only in estimates of model parameters but also in
               the subsequent construction of prediction intervals. The latter
               are typically too narrow, partly because they do not allow for

               the AIC for identifying a model on the basis of within-sample
               fit, but out-of-sample forecasting accuracy provides the real
               test. Alternative approaches to forecasting, which avoid

               aversion - the displeasure from suffering a loss is larger than
               the pleasure enjoyed from an equivalent-sized gain - and that
               expectations are important in determining what is perceived as a
               loss. Recent research suggests that disappointing results in
               sporting fixtures relative to prematch expectations play an
               important role in triggering domestic violence (Card and Dahl,
               2011), consistent with the idea of loss aversion around
               expectations-based reference points. This paper seeks to
               investigate whether such behaviour is exhibited by football fans
               in Glasgow by looking at the relationship between match outcomes

               there are large increases in domestic violence (regardless of
               the outcome of the match), in other matches disappointing
               results relative to expectations are not linked to increased
               domestic violence, except when those matches occur at the very

               environmental effects and statistical noise into a producer
               performance evaluation based on data envelopment analysis (DEA).
               The technique involves a three-stage analysis. In the first
               stage, DEA is applied to outputs and inputs only, to obtain
               initial measures of producer performance. In the second stage,
               stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) is used to regress first
               stage performance measures against a set of environmental
               variables. This provides, for each input or output (depending on
               the orientation of the first stage DEA model), a three-way
               decomposition of the variation in performance into a part
               attributable to environmental effects, a part attributable to
               managerial inefficiency, and a part attributable to statistical
               noise. In the third stage, either inputs or outputs (again
               depending on the orientation of the first stage DEA model) are
               adjusted to account for the impact of the environmental effects
               and the statistical noise uncovered in the second stage, and DEA
               is used to re-evaluate producer performance. Throughout the
               analysis emphasis is placed on slacks, rather than on radial
               efficiency scores, as appropriate measures of producer
               performance. An application to nursing homes is provided to

              However, the extant methods either neglect the adverse impact on
              the financial system posed by a bank or ignore the various
              interactions among banks. To resolve this issue, the objective of
              this study is to put forward an expected default based score
              (EDBS) that overcomes the drawbacks of the existing methods from
              the perspective of contagion risk. This indicator measures the
              systemic importance of a bank by calculating the expected bank
              defaults triggered by its initial failure. In the empirical
              study, the expected default based score is applied to identify
              the systemically important banks in the Chinese banking system.
              Both the quantitative comparison with other major methods and the
              qualitative evaluation of the Delphi method validate the
              reliability of the EDBS method. The empirical results also

  abstract  = "ABSTRACTWe develop robust inference methods for studying linear
               dependence between the jumps of discretely observed processes at
               high frequency. Unlike classical linear regressions, jump
               regressions are determined by a small number of jumps occurring
               over a fixed time interval and the rest of the components of the
               processes around the jump times. The latter are the continuous
               martingale parts of the processes as well as observation noise.
               By sampling more frequently the role of these components, which
               are hidden in the observed price, shrinks asymptotically. The
               robustness of our inference procedure is with respect to
               outliers, which are of particular importance in the current
               setting of relatively small number of jump observations. This is
               achieved by using nonsmooth loss functions (like L1) in the
               estimation. Unlike classical robust methods, the limit of the
               objective function here remains nonsmooth. The proposed method
               is also robust to measurement error in the observed processes,
               which is achieved by locally smoothing the high-frequency
               increments. In an empirical application to financial data, we
               illustrate the usefulness of the robust techniques by
               contrasting the behavior of robust and ordinary least regression
               (OLS)-type jump regressions in periods including disruptions of
               the financial markets such as so-called ?flash crashes.?

              relies on formal cointegration testing to unveil stationary

              optimal trading rules for mean-reverting spreads. The stochastic
              control approach aims at identifying optimal portfolio holdings
              in the legs of a pairs trade relative to other available
              securities. The category ``other approaches'' contains further
              relevant pairs trading frameworks with only a limited set of

               for financial assets. Noise causes markets to be somewhat
               inefficient, but often prevents us from taking advantage of
               inefficiencies. Noise in the form of uncertainty about future
               tastes and technology by sector causes business cycles, and
               makes them highly resistant to improvement through government
               intervention. Noise in the form of expectations that need not

               their contribution to the overall risk of the banking system we
               have to consider that the risk of the banking system as well as
               each bank's risk contribution changes once bank equity capital
               gets reallocated. We define macroprudential capital requirements
               as the fixed point at which each bank's capital requirement
               equals its contribution to the risk of the system under the
               proposed capital requirements. We use a network based structural
               model to measure systemic risk and how it changes with bank
               capital and allocate risk to individual banks based on five risk
               allocation mechanisms used in the literature. Using a sample of
               Canadian banks we find that macroprudential capital allocations
               can differ by as much as 25\% from observed capital levels, are
               not trivially related to bank size or individual bank default
               probability, increase in interbank assets, and differ
               substantially from a simple risk attribution analysis. We
               further find that across all risk allocation mechanisms
               macroprudential capital requirements reduce the default
               probabilities of individual banks as well as the probability of
               a systemic crisis by about 25\%. Macroprudential capital
               requirements are robust to model risk and are positively

               evidence on the cost function and apparent cost-optimizing
               behavior of the local managers of 33 county jails in Tennessee.
               Two main arguments were advanced: (1) line-item budgeting (LIB)
               was an ineffective control because the cost shares are assumed
               fixed in such budgetary settings, and (2) the budgetary control
               and performance evaluation process in not-for-profit settings
               could be improved if the underlying cost function was estimated
               by using a flexible functional form such as the translog to gain
               knowledge of possible input substitution and output
               transformation. This translog budget model was viewed implicitly
               as a superior alternative to the more traditional LIB approach.
               The main objective of this study is to extend Hayes and Millar's
               idea of a translog budget model by outlining a more complete
               budgetary system. It is shown that a frontier cost function
               generated from the ordinary least squares (OLS) translog
               function can be used to identify four types of inefficiencies:
               the degree of technical, allocative, and scale inefficiency as
               well as institutional X-inefficiency (Liebenstein 1966). These
               four types of inefficiencies are then linked to both the
               long-term and short-term objectives of budgeting; namely,
               performance evaluation, subordinate manager motivation,
               planning, and control. The second objective of the study is to
               compare the translog budget model (as revised) against the most
               frequently applied alternative technique, the nonparametric data
               envelopment analysis (DEA), in the same context. From the
               standpoint of a routine budgetary control system, it was found
               that the DEA model is more suitable than the translog model. In
               not-for-profit settings, however, an econometric model such as
               the translog may be needed initially in the specification of the
               most appropriate input and output measures. Although the
               effectiveness of LIB as a control is not addressed directly, our
               analysis shows that the line-item data mandatory with this
               approach is an essential part of any effective budgetary system

               multiple performance dimensions. It advances the following
               research question: Are there significant differences in
               organizational performance between nonprofit and for-profit
               sport organizations?Research methods: Data from a nationwide
               online survey of nonprofit (n = 1640) and for-profit sport
               organizations (n = 732) in German equestrian sport are used for
               the empirical analysis. The challenge was to find adequate
               measures for the comparison of the two types of legal forms.
               Altogether, 22 regression models for performance measures across
               four dimensions (financial, product, customer, strategic) are
               estimated with the legal form (nonprofit vs. for-profit) and
               some controls as independent variables.Results and findings: The
               results show that for-profit organizations outperform nonprofit
               organizations in terms of overall financial performance, while
               nonprofits excel with regard to price structure. For-profits
               attach more importance to program quality, employee
               qualifications, and strategies. No significant differences can
               be observed in the product dimension. However, for-profits tend
               to focus on customer groups that have typically been targeted by
               nonprofits. Since the models also control for organizational
               size and resources, the results indicate that differences are
               not always attributable to the legal form.Implications: The
               findings imply that for-profits do not outperform nonprofits in
               all performance dimensions. Nonprofits should consider that
               for-profits have invaded some of their typical domains and
               should be more flexible when market demand changes, while
               for-profits should reconsider their price structure.",

              evaluate scale and X-inefficiencies, as well as technical change
              for a sample of Japanese commercial banks between 1993 and 1996.
              Loan-loss provisions are included in the cost frontier model to
              control for output quality, with a financial capital and a
              liquidity ratio included to control risk. Following the approach
              suggested in Mester (1996) we show that if risk and quality
              factors are not taken into account optimal bank size tends to be
              overstated. That is, optimal bank size is considerably smaller
              when risk and quality factors are taken into account when
              modelling the cost characteristics of Japanese banks. We also
              find that the level of financial capital has the biggest
              influence on the scale efficiency estimates. X-inefficiency
              estimates, in contrast, appear less sensitive to risk and quality
              factors. Our results also suggest that scale inefficiencies
              dominate X-inefficiencies. These are important findings because
              they contrast with the results of previous studies on Japanese
              banking. In particular, the results indicate an alternative
              policy prescription, namely, that the largest banks should shrink
              to benefit from scale advantages. It also seems that financial

  abstract  = "Understanding the effects of operational conditions and
               practices on productive efficiency can provide valuable economic
               and managerial insights. The conventional approach is to use a
               two-stage method where the efficiency estimates are regressed on
               contextual variables representing the operational conditions.
               The main problem of the two-stage approach is that it ignores
               the correlations between inputs and contextual variables. To
               address this shortcoming, we build on the recently developed
               regression interpretation of data envelopment analysis (DEA) to
               develop a new one-stage semi-nonparametric estimator that
               combines the nonparametric DEA-style frontier with a regression
               model of the contextual variables. The new method is referred to
               as stochastic semi-nonparametric envelopment of z variables data
               (StoNEZD). The StoNEZD estimator for the contextual variables is
               shown to be statistically consistent under less restrictive
               assumptions than those required by the two-stage DEA estimator.
               Further, the StoNEZD estimator is shown to be unbiased,
               asymptotically efficient, asymptotically normally distributed,
               and converge at the standard parametric rate of order n−1/2.
               Therefore, the conventional methods of statistical testing and
               confidence intervals apply for asymptotic inference. Finite

              question presented in this article is whether there are any
              management tools available for clubs which they can use to
              improve their business competitiveness above and beyond the
              limitations of their maximum market size. According to the
              research hypothesis, there is such a tool available for clubs:
              the management and operation of a football club in a
              well-organized and business-like manner. The method of analysis
              is the so-called Grounded Theory (Glaser, \& Strauss, 1967;
              Locke, 2001), which is an abstract analytical schema with a
              systematic data analysis process. The data collection
              incorporates desk research, comparative analysis, organizational
              review, and in-depth interviews. The results are presented
              according to the following dimensions: a) relevance of the
              research question; b) specification of groups of relevant
              management tools; c) the role of the national football
              association in the process of market development; d) the role of
              the owners in this process; and e) how the structure of the
              sector and its operating processes can guarantee the efficient
              utilization of all the material resources which have been plowed
              into the sector over the last four to five years. According to
              the conclusions, the creation of an operating system and club
              model that allows for the utilization of resources - maximized
              market revenues and governmental sources - in the most effective
              way is an unavoidable challenge. The formation of the sustainable
              operations of clubs is fundamentally influenced by club owners.
              An inspection of the interaction between club owners, head
              coaches, and players is a key task in the process of creating a
              new club model.",

  abstract = "Purpose -- The purpose of this paper is three‐fold. First, to
              explore the relationship between the financial and sporting
              performance of clubs competing in the English Premier League
              (EPL). Second, to investigate the effect of different models of
              EPL club ownership on financial and league performance. Third, to
              review the finances of EPL clubs in the context of UEFA's
              Financial Fair Play regulations.Design/methodology/approach --
              Financial data from annual reports for the period 2001‐2010 was
              collected for 20 EPL clubs. Correlation analysis was conducted to
              examine the relationship between the finances of EPL clubs and
              their league position. One‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests
              were then used to examine the effect of ownership type on clubs'
              financial and league performances. Where the results of ANOVA
              testing revealed statistically significant differences between
              groups, these were investigated further using appropriate post
              hoc procedures.Findings -- The stock market model of ownership
              returned better financial health relative to privately owned
              (domestic and foreign) clubs. However, clubs owned privately by
              foreign investors or on the stock market performed better in the
              league in comparison with domestically owned clubs. The stock
              market model was more likely to comply with Financial Fair Play
              regulations.Originality/value -- The paper confirms empirically
              that football clubs that float on the stock market are in better
              financial health and that clubs in pursuit of short‐term sporting
              excellence are reliant on substantial investment, in this case

               on a nationwide level. Applying a univariate time series
               approach, the results from the quarterly transaction-based
               Nationwide Building Society indices from 1974 to 2009 provide
               empirical evidence for a high persistence of house price
               movements. In addition to conducting parametric and
               non-parametric tests, we provide technical trading strategies as
               a robustness check to compare predictability across markets and
               to test whether or not the detected persistence can also be used

               of the time change in the log cost function. Our econometric

               shifts in the frontier and changes in firm efficiency levels

               non-frontier specification is nested within our frontier model

               Using a panel of twelve US railroads from 1951 to 1975, our

               growth of roughly 0.3 percent, with efficiency change rising

              managers. Funds with all female managers perform no differently
              than all male-managed funds and have similar risk profiles. For
              single-style funds, those with mixed teams of both genders
              underperform male-only funds on both a raw and risk-adjusted
              basis, although mixed funds incur less risk and their Sharpe
              ratios do not differ. For funds of funds, both all-female and
              mixed funds have similar performance to male-managed funds. We
              then consider the failure rate across all fund styles. Funds with

              international contagion in banking during the 2007--2009 crisis

              associated with the presence of both systematic and idiosyncratic

              a foreign jurisdiction via idiosyncratic contagion increase the

              almost 37 percent, whereas increased exposure via systematic
              contagion does not necessarily destabilize the domestic banking
              system. Thus while policy makers and regulatory authorities are

  abstract  = "The recent banking crisis has revealed the existence of strong
               resiliency factors in the retail banking business model. On
               average, retail banks suffered less than other financial
               institutions from unexpected market changes. This paper proposes
               a new methodology to measure retail banks' business risk, which
               is defined as the risk of adverse and unexpected changes in
               banks' profits coming from sudden changes in the banks'
               activities. This methodology is based on the efficiency frontier
               methodology, and, more specifically, on the duality property
               between the directional distance function and the profit
               function. Using the distance function to compute banks'
               profitability, we take the distance to the frontier of best
               practices as a measure of profit inefficiency, i.e. of
               unexpected losses related to underperformance. In this approach,
               shifts in the efficiency frontier induced by adverse shocks to
               banks' volumes serve as a measure of business risk. This measure
               of profit volatility allows a measurement to be made of the
               impact of volume changes on banks' profits. This method is
               applied to a database containing half yearly regulatory
               accounting reports over the 1993--2011 period for a sample of
               quite all French banks running a retail banking business model.

               deregulation on bank efficiency, (ii) bank efficiency across

               efficiency, and (iv) impact of mergers and acquisitions on bank
               efficiency. In addition, two prominent research issues in the
               banking efficiency literature have also been discussed in this
               chapter. The first issue relates with the selection and
               specification of inputs and outputs in a study on the subject
               matter. The second issue is on the selection of appropriate
               frontier efficiency technique to measure bank efficiency.
               Regarding the first issue, we note that though both
               intermediation and production approaches are not perfect to
               model the production process of banking firms, but the former
               dominates the latter in the empirical applications because it is
               better suited to capture the decisions taken to minimize the
               cost of the financing mix. On the second issue, we note that a
               bank's efficiency score can differ completely due to the
               measurement technique, and there is virtually no consensus on

               the heterogeneity in results and the absence of a comprehensive
               review aimed at understanding the reasons for this variability.
               Surprisingly, although this issue is well-known, it has not been
               systematically analyzed before. In order to fill this gap, we
               perform a Meta-Regression-Analysis (MRA) by examining 1661
               efficiency scores retrieved from 120 papers published over the
               period 2000?2014. The meta-regression is estimated by using the
               Random Effects Multilevel Model (REML) because it controls for
               within- and between-study heterogeneity. The analysis yields
               four main results. First, parametric methods yield lower levels
               of banking efficiency than nonparametric studies. This holds
               true even after controlling for the approach used in selecting
               the inputs and outputs of the frontier. Secondly, we show that
               banking efficiency is highest when using the value-added
               approach, followed by estimates from studies based on the
               intermediation method, whereas those based on the hybrid
               approach are the lowest. Thirdly, efficiency scores are also
               determined by the quality of studies and the number of
               observations and variables used in the primary papers. As far as
               the effects of sample size, dimension and quality of papers are
               concerned, there are significant differences in sign and
               magnitude between parametric and nonparametric studies. Finally,
               cost efficiency is found to be higher than profit efficiency.

               hypothesis by correlating individual overconfidence scores with
               several measures of trading volume of individual investors.
               Approximately 3,000 online broker investors were asked to answer
               an internet questionnaire which was designed to measure various
               facets of overconfidence (miscalibration, volatility estimates,
               better than average effect). The measures of trading volume were
               calculated by the trades of 215 individual investors who
               answered the questionnaire. We find that investors who think
               that they are above average in terms of investment skills or
               past performance (but who did not have above average performance
               in the past) trade more. Measures of miscalibration are,
               contrary to theory, unrelated to measures of trading volume.
               This result is striking as theoretical models that incorporate
               overconfident investors mainly motivate this assumption by the
               calibration literature and model overconfidence as
               underestimation of the variance of signals. In connection with
               other recent findings, we conclude that the usual way of
               motivating and modeling overconfidence which is mainly based on
               the calibration literature has to be treated with caution.

               several nonparametric frontier estimators based on the idea of
               enveloping the data (FDH and DEA-type estimators). Many have
               claimed that FDH and DEA techniques are non-statistical, as
               opposed to econometric approaches where particular parametric
               expressions are posited to model the frontier. We can now define

               properties of the nonparametric estimators in the multi-output
               and multi-input case. New results provide the asymptotic
               sampling distribution of the FDH estimator in a multivariate
               setting and of the DEA estimator in the bivariate case. Sampling
               distributions may also be approximated by bootstrap

  abstract  = "In management contexts, mathematical programming is usually used
               to evaluate a collection of possible alternative courses of
               action en route to selecting one which is best. In this
               capacity, mathematical programming serves as a planning aid to
               management. Data Envelopment Analysis reverses this role and
               employs mathematical programming to obtain ex post facto
               evaluations of the relative efficiency of management
               accomplishments, however they may have been planned or executed.
               Mathematical programming is thereby extended for use as a tool
               for control and evaluation of past accomplishments as well as a
               tool to aid in planning future activities. The CCR ratio form
               introduced by Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes, as part of their Data
               Envelopment Analysis approach, comprehends both technical and
               scale inefficiencies via the optimal value of the ratio form, as
               obtained directly from the data without requiring a priori
               specification of weights and/or explicit delineation of assumed
               functional forms of relations between inputs and outputs. A
               separation into technical and scale efficiencies is accomplished
               by the methods developed in this paper without altering the
               latter conditions for use of DEA directly on observational data.
               Technical inefficiencies are identified with failures to achieve
               best possible output levels and/or usage of excessive amounts of
               inputs. Methods for identifying and correcting the magnitudes of
               these inefficiencies, as supplied in prior work, are
               illustrated. In the present paper, a new separate variable is
               introduced which makes it possible to determine whether
               operations were conducted in regions of increasing, constant or
               decreasing returns to scale (in multiple input and multiple
               output situations). The results are discussed and related not
               only to classical (single output) economics but also to more

              deregulation, and the 1997/1998 South East Asian crisis do not

  abstract  = "Purpose -- This paper aims to analyze bank efficiency into a
               number of bank‐specific, industry‐specific and macroeconomic
               determinants.Design/methodology/approach -- The authors follow a
               semi‐parametric two‐stage methodology, where productive
               efficiency is derived via a non‐parametric technique in the
               first stage and then the scores obtained are linked to a series
               of determinants of bank efficiency, using a double bootstrapping
               procedure.Findings -- Overall, it is found that the banking
               sectors of almost all the sample countries show a gradual
               improvement in their efficiency levels. The model used shows
               that a number of determinants like bank size, industry
               concentration and the investment environment have a positive
               impact on bank efficiency, which is not the case when standard
               Tobit models are employed.Research limitations/implications --
               The findings have important implications for the relevance of
               well‐known hypotheses that refer to the performance of the
               banking sectors, like the structure‐conduct‐performance and the
               efficient structure hypotheses. These implications are not
               necessarily verified when past conventional econometric
               methodologies are used.Practical implications -- The paper
               offers new insights to policy makers, bank managers and
               practitioners on the relevance of a number of driving factors of
               bank efficiency that might help them to improve the performance
               of the banking system and enhance the quality of services
               provided.Originality/value -- This is the first paper in the
               bank efficiency literature that employs a semi‐parametric
               two‐stage model, which relaxes several deficiencies of previous
               two‐stage empirical approaches thus, offering a solution to the
               many problematic features of standard censored regressions.",

               best-practices as a means to improve performance. Data
               envelopment analysis (DEA) has been demonstrated to be a
               powerful benchmarking methodology for situations where multiple
               inputs and outputs need to be assessed to identify
               best-practices and improve productivity in organizations. Most
               DEA benchmarking studies have excluded quality, even in
               service-sector applications such as health care where quality is
               a key element of performance. This limits the practical value of
               DEA in organizations where maintaining and improving service
               quality is critical to achieving performance objectives. In this
               paper, alternative methods incorporating quality in DEA
               benchmarking are demonstrated and evaluated. It is shown that
               simply treating the quality measures as DEA outputs does not
               help in discriminating the performance. Thus, the current study
               presents a new, more sensitive, quality-adjusted DEA (Q-DEA),
               which effectively deals with quality measures in benchmarking.
               We report the results of applying Q-DEA to a U.S. bank's
               200-branch network that required a method for benchmarking to
               help manage operating costs and service quality. Q-DEA findings
               helped the bank achieve cost savings and improved operations
               while preserving service quality, a dimension critical to its
               mission. New insights about ways to improve branch operations
               based on the best-practice (high-quality low-cost) benchmarks
               identified with Q-DEA are also described in the paper. This
               demonstrates the practical need and potential benefits of Q-DEA
               and its efficacy in one application, and also suggests the need

              The normal function of IgA is immune exclusion. In its absence,
              allergens can pass through the mucosa and stimulate the
              immunocompetent cells. The T cell defect may also be implied by
              the synthesis of IgE directed against the allergens which passed
              through. Clinical, biological and immunological findings (T cell
              defect in allergic disease, low range of IgA in the early life of
              atopics) are in agreement. The genetic factor for pollinosis and
              house dust allergy are segregated. In ragweed allergy there is an
              Ir gene coding for antigen-specific Ig of different classes and a
              group of non-linked major histocompatibility complex alleles
              coding for non antigen-specific IgE. There are some links with

              need allergens and environmental factors to induce allergy.
              Allergy is a complex state in which several mechanisms, often
              associated and sometimes unclear, are involved. Some of them may
              be an abnormality of the autonomic nervous system, and/or an

  abstract = "In productivity analysis an important issue is to detect how
              external (environmental) factors, exogenous to the production
              process and not under the control of the producer, might
              influence the production process and the resulting efficiency of
              the firms. Most of the traditional approaches proposed in the
              literature have serious drawbacks. An alternative approach is to
              describe the production process as being conditioned by a given
              value of the environmental variables (Cazals, C., Florens, J.P.,
              Simar, L., 2002. Nonparametric Frontier estimation: A robust
              approach. Journal of Econometrics 106, 1--25; Daraio, C., Simar,

              Frontier models: A probabilistic approach. Journal of
              Productivity Analysis 24(1), 93--121). This defines conditional
              efficiency measures where the production set in the
              input$\times$output space may depend on the value of the external
              variables. The statistical properties of nonparametric estimators
              of these conditional measures are now established (Jeong, S.O.,
              Park, B.U., Simar, L., 2008. Nonparametric conditional efficiency
              measures: Asymptotic properties. Annals of Operations Research
              doi: 10.1007/s10479-008-0359-5). These involve the estimation of
              a nonstandard conditional distribution function which requires
              the specification of a smoothing parameter (a bandwidth). So far,
              only the asymptotic optimal order of this bandwidth has been
              established. This is of little interest for the practitioner. In
              this paper we fill this gap and we propose a data-driven
              technique for selecting this parameter in practice. The approach,
              based on a Least Squares Cross Validation procedure (LSCV),
              provides an optimal bandwidth that minimizes an appropriate
              (weighted) integrated Squared Error (ISE). The method is
              carefully described and exemplified with some simulated data with
              univariate and multivariate environmental factors. An application
              on real data (performances of Mutual Funds) illustrates how this

              measuring efficiency changes over time, e.g. the window analysis
              and the Malmquist index. However, they usually neglect carry-over
              activities between two consecutive terms and only focus on the
              separate time period independently aiming local optimization in a
              single period, even if these models can take into account the
              time change effect. In the actual business world, a long time
              planning and investment is a subject of great concern. For these
              cases, single period optimization model is not suitable for
              performance evaluation. To cope with long time point of view, the
              dynamic DEA model incorporates carry-over activities into the
              model and enables us to measure period specific efficiency based
              on the long time optimization during the whole period. Dynamic
              DEA model proposed by F{\"a}re and Grosskopf is the first
              innovative contribution for such purpose. In this paper we
              develop their model in the slacks-based measure (SBM) framework,
              called dynamic SBM (DSBM). The SBM model is non-radial and can
              deal with inputs/outputs individually, contrary to the radial
              approaches that assume proportional changes in inputs/outputs.
              Furthermore, according to the characteristics of carry-overs, we
              classify them into four categories, i.e. desirable, undesirable,
              free and fixed. Desirable carry-overs correspond, for example, to
              profit carried forward and net earned surplus carried to the next
              term, while undesirable carry-overs include, for example, loss
              carried forward, bad debt and dead stock. Free and fixed
              carry-overs indicate, respectively, discretionary and
              non-discretionary ones. We develop dynamic SBM models that can
              evaluate the overall efficiency of decision making units for the
              whole terms as well as the term efficiencies.",

              external or environmental factors which may influence the
              production process, affect the performances and explain the
              efficiency differentials. Recently introduced conditional
              efficiency measures (Daraio and Simar, 2005, 2007a,b), including
              conditional FDH, conditional DEA, conditional order-m and

              performance of Decision Making Units in a nonparametric
              framework. This paper contributes in a twofold fashion. It first
              extends previous studies by showing that a careful analysis of
              both full and partial conditional measures allows the
              disentangling of the impact of environmental factors on the

              interrelationships, both from an individual and a global
              perspective. Second, this paper examines the impact of
              environmental factors on the production process in a new
              two-stage type approach but using conditional measures to avoid
              the flaws of the traditional two-stage analysis. This novel
              approach also provides a measure of inefficiency whitened from
              the main effect of the environmental factors allowing a ranking
              of units according to their managerial efficiency, even when
              facing heterogeneous environmental conditions. The paper includes

               frontiers for outlier detection. In evaluating its predictive
               performance, we develop a novel predictive DEA procedure, PDEA,
               which extends the conventional DEA approaches that have been
               primarily used for in-sample efficiency estimation, to predict
               outputs for the out-of-sample. This enables us to compare the

               outlier detection methods including the parametric robust
               regression in statistics and non-parametric k-means in data
               mining. We conduct comprehensive simulation experiments to
               examine the relative performance of these outlier detection
               methods under the influence of five factors: sample size,
               linearity of production function, normality of noise
               distribution, homogeneity of data, and levels of random noise

  abstract = "Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is widely used as a benchmarking
              tool for improving productive performance of decision making
              units (DMUs). The benchmarks produced by DEA are obtained as a
              side-product of computing efficiency scores. As a result, the
              benchmark units may differ from the evaluated DMU in terms of
              their input--output profiles and the scale size. Moreover, the
              DEA benchmarks may operate in a more favorable environment than
              the evaluated DMU. Further, DEA is sensitive to stochastic noise,
              which can affect the benchmarking exercise. In this paper we
              propose a new approach to benchmarking that combines the frontier
              estimation techniques with clustering methods. More specifically,
              we propose to apply some clustering methods to identify groups of
              DMUs that are similar in terms of their input--output profiles or
              other observed characteristics. We then rank DMUs in the
              descending order of efficiency within each cluster. The
              cluster-specific efficiency rankings enable the management to
              identify not only the most efficient benchmark, but also other
              peers that operate more efficiently within the same cluster. The
              proposed approach is flexible to combine any clustering method
              with any frontier estimation technique. The inputs of clustering
              and efficiency analysis are user-specified and can be
              multi-dimensional. We present a real world application to the
              regulation of electricity distribution networks in Finland, where
              the regulator uses the semi-nonparametric StoNED method
              (stochastic non-parametric envelopment of data). StoNED can be
              seen as a stochastic extension of DEA that takes the noise term
              explicitly into account. We find that the cluster-specific
              efficiency rankings provide more meaningful benchmarks than the
              conventional approach of using the intensity weights obtained as
              a side-product of efficiency analysis.",

               effects derived from stochastic production frontiers have been
               estimated from residuals which are sensitive to specification
               errors. This study corrects for this inaccuracy by extending the
               doubly heteroscedastic stochastic cost frontier suggested by
               Hadri (1999) to the model for technical inefficiency effects.
               This model is a stochastic frontier production function for
               panel data as proposed by Battese and Coelli (1995). The study
               uses, for illustration of the techniques, data on 101 mainly
               cereal farms in England. We find that the correction for
               heteroscedasticity is supported by the data. Both point
               estimates and confidence intervals for technical efficiencies
               are provided. The confidence intervals are constructed by
               extending the ``Battese-Coelli'' method reported by Horrace and
               Schmidt (1996) by allowing the technical inefficiency to be time
               varying and the disturbance terms to be heteroscedastic. The
               confidence intervals reveal the precision of technical

                 Denmark, we show that the impacts of retirement savings
                 policies on wealth accumulation depend on whether they change
                 savings rates by active or passive choice. Subsidies for
                 retirement accounts, which rely upon individuals to take an
                 action to raise savings, primarily induce individuals to shift
                 assets from taxable accounts to retirement accounts. We
                 estimate that each \$1 of government expenditure on subsidies
                 increases total saving by only 1 cent. In contrast, policies
                 that raise retirement contributions if individuals take no
                 action - such as automatic employer contributions to
                 retirement accounts - increase wealth accumulation
                 substantially. We estimate that approximately 15\% of
                 individuals are ``active savers'' who respond to tax subsidies
                 primarily by shifting assets across accounts. 85\% of
                 individuals are ``passive savers'' who are unresponsive to
                 subsidies but are instead heavily influenced by automatic
                 contributions made on their behalf. Active savers tend to be
                 wealthier and more financially sophisticated. We conclude that
                 automatic contributions are more effective at increasing
                 savings rates than subsidies for three reasons: (1) subsidies
                 induce relatively few individuals to respond, (2) they
                 generate substantial crowd-out conditional on response, and

  abstract = "Behavioral economics tells us that emotions can profoundly affect
              individual behavior and decision-making. Does this also apply to
              societies at large, i.e. can societies experience mood states
              that affect their collective decision making? By extension is the
              public mood correlated or even predictive of economic indicators?
              Here we investigate whether measurements of collective mood
              states derived from large-scale Twitter feeds are correlated to
              the value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) over time.
              We analyze the text content of daily Twitter feeds by two mood
              tracking tools, namely OpinionFinder that measures positive vs.
              negative mood and Google-Profile of Mood States (GPOMS) that
              measures mood in terms of 6 dimensions (Calm, Alert, Sure, Vital,
              Kind, and Happy). We cross-validate the resulting mood time
              series by comparing their ability to detect the public's response
              to the presidential election and Thanksgiving day in 2008. A
              Granger causality analysis and a Self-Organizing Fuzzy Neural
              Network are then used to investigate the hypothesis that public
              mood states, as measured by the OpinionFinder and GPOMS mood time
              series, are predictive of changes in DJIA closing values. Our
              results indicate that the accuracy of DJIA predictions can be
              significantly improved by the inclusion of specific public mood
              dimensions but not others. We find an accuracy of 86.7\% in
              predicting the daily up and down changes in the closing values of
              the DJIA and a reduction of the Mean Average Percentage Error
              (MAPE) by more than 6\%.",

  abstract = "We study the time-varying risk exposures of US bank holding
              companies for the 1986--2012 period by decomposing total bank
              risk into systematic banking-industry risk, systematic
              market-wide risk, and idiosyncratic bank risk. Banking-industry
              risk factors directly relate to the banks' financial
              intermediation functions while market-wide risk factors affect
              all stocks. In contrast, idiosyncratic risk is driven by
              individual bank risk characteristics. We analyze the systematic
              bank risk factors in time series regressions, determine their
              importance with a democratic orthogonalization technique, and
              explore the idiosyncratic risk in a panel regression framework.
              Our results suggest that corporate credit risk and real estate
              risk are most detrimental in crisis periods, while banks'
              interest rate risk sensitivity has changed over the last decade.
              The banks' equity ratio, loan-loss provisions, fraction of real
              estate loans, and proportion of non-interest income relate to the
              differences in individual bank risk. Moreover, banks'
              idiosyncratic risk contains a strong state-level business cycle
              component. Our results are robust to alternative risk factor
              specifications. Overall, our study contributes to understanding

  abstract = "In the US, most economists argue that professional sports teams
              are profit-maximising businesses, but it is a widely held view in
              Europe that professional football clubs are not run on a
              profit-maximising basis. This belief has important implications
              for the impact of widely-advocated policy measures, such as
              revenue sharing. This paper looks at the performance of 16
              English football clubs that acquired a stock exchange listing in
              the mid-1990s. If the European story is true, we should have
              observed a shift toward profit-maximising behaviour at these
              clubs, under the assumption that investors were attracted to
              these football clubs to earn a positive return. This paper finds
              no evidence of any shift in the behaviour of these 16 clubs after
              flotation. This result is consistent with the view that football
              clubs in England have been much more oriented toward profit

               which second-stage regressions are well-defined and meaningful.
               In the model considered by Simar and Wilson (J Prod Anal
               13:49--78, 2007), truncated regression provides consistent

               generally over the past seventeen years.While attitudes toward
               regulation have changed several times in the intervening years
               and government regulation has waxed and waned, the question of
               whether to regulate more or to regulate less is a topic of
               constant debate, one that The Economics of Regulation addresses
               incisively. It clearly remains the standard work in the field, a
               starting point and reference tool for anyone working in
               regulation.Kahn points out that while dramatic changes have come
               about in the structurally competitive industries - the airlines,
               trucking, stock exchange brokerage services, railroads, buses,
               cable television, oil and natural gas - the consensus about the
               desirability and necessity for regulated monopoly in public
               utilities has likewise been dissolving, under the burdens of
               inflation, fuel crises, and the traumatic experience with
               nuclear plants. Kahn reviews and assesses the changes in both
               areas: he is particularly frank in his appraisal of the effect
               of deregulation on the airlines.His conclusion today mirrors
               that of his original, seminal work - that different industries
               need different mixes of institutional arrangements that cannot
               be decided on the basis of ideology.Alfred E. Kahn is Robert

               investors, and suggest research gaps that deserve further
               attention. The authors have also constructed a unique database

               France, Germany, and Italy for the period from 2003 to

               research field of football club investors cover various
               theoretical areas, such as the application of property rights
               theory to European football clubs. In addition, several

               future research may address the paradox of de-listings in
               England and additional listings in continental Europe. Finally,

               multi-ownership synergies as promising research fields. In this

              of \$1 billion) in the United States, over the period from 2000
              to 2005. This is done by estimating an output distance function

              grew at an average rate of 1.98\% over the sample period.
              However, our estimates also show a clear downward trend in the
              growth rate of total factor productivity and our decomposition of

              its three components -- technical change, efficiency change, and
              economies of scale -- indicates that technical change is the

               Utilizing the mean-variance model, the following results are

               ineffective means to bound the insolvency risk of banks; (b) as

               the risk in a banking system. Standard tools that regulators
               require banks to use for their internal risk management are
               applied at the level of the banking system to measure the risk
               of a regulator's portfolio. Using a sample of international
               banks from 1988 until 2002, I estimate the dynamics and
               correlations between bank asset portfolios. To obtain measures
               for the risk of a regulator's portfolio, I model the individual
               liabilities that the regulator has to each bank as contingent
               claims on the bank's assets. The portfolio aspect of the
               regulator's liability is explicitly considered and the
               methodology allows a comparison of sub-samples from different
               countries. Correlations, bank asset volatility, and bank
               capitalization increase for North American and somewhat for
               European banks, while Japanese banks face deteriorating capital
               levels. In the sample period, the North American banking system
               gains stability while the Japanese banking sector becomes more
               fragile. The expected future liability of the regulator varies
               substantially over time and is especially high during the Asian
               crisis starting in 1997. Further analysis shows that the
               Japanese banks contribute most to the volatility of the
               regulator's liability at that time. Larger and more profitable
               banks have lower systemic risk and additional equity capital
               reduces systemic risk only for banks that are constrained by
               regulatory capital requirements.",

  abstract  = "Abstract The problem of testing a point null hypothesis (or a
               ?small interval? null hypothesis) is considered. Of interest is
               the relationship between the P value (or observed significance
               level) and conditional and Bayesian measures of evidence against
               the null hypothesis. Although one might presume that a small P
               value indicates the presence of strong evidence against the
               null, such is not necessarily the case. Expanding on earlier
               work [especially Edwards, Lindman, and Savage (1963) and Dickey
               (1977)], it is shown that actual evidence against a null (as
               measured, say, by posterior probability or comparative
               likelihood) can differ by an order of magnitude from the P
               value. For instance, data that yield a P value of .05, when
               testing a normal mean, result in a posterior probability of the
               null of at least .30 for any objective prior distribution.
               (?Objective? here means that equal prior weight is given the two
               hypotheses and that the prior is symmetric and nonincreasing
               away from the null; other definitions of ?objective? will be
               seen to yield qualitatively similar results.) The overall
               conclusion is that P values can be highly misleading measures of

  abstract = "Abstract We put forward a framework for measuring systemic risk
              and attributing it to individual banks. Systemic risk is
              coherently measured as the expected loss to depositors and
              investors when a systemic event occurs. The risk contributions
              are calculated so as to ensure a full risk allocation among
              institutions. Applying our methodology to a panel of 54--86 of
              the world's major commercial banks for a 13-year time span with
              monthly frequency not only allows us to closely match the list of
              G-SIBs; we can also use individual risk contributions to compute
              bank-specific surcharges: systemic capital charges as well as
              countercyclical buffers. We therefore address both dimensions of
              systemic risk -- cross-sectional and time-series -- in a single
              integrated approach. As the analysis of risk drivers confirms,
              the main focus of macroprudential supervision should be on a
              solid capital base throughout the financial cycle and

              range of disciplines, including epidemiology, health services

              three families of regression models for the analysis of
              multilevel survival data. First, Cox proportional hazards models
              with mixed effects incorporate cluster-specific random effects
              that modify the baseline hazard function. Second, piecewise
              exponential survival models partition the duration of follow-up
              into mutually exclusive intervals and fit a model that assumes
              that the hazard function is constant within each interval. This
              is equivalent to a Poisson regression model that incorporates the
              duration of exposure within each interval. By incorporating
              cluster-specific random effects, generalised linear mixed models
              can be used to analyse these data. Third, after partitioning the
              duration of follow-up into mutually exclusive intervals, one can
              use discrete time survival models that use a complementary
              log--log generalised linear model to model the occurrence of the
              outcome of interest within each interval. Random effects can be
              incorporated to account for within-cluster homogeneity in
              outcomes. We illustrate the application of these methods using
              data consisting of patients hospitalised with a heart attack. We

              factors associated with time-to-event data. Because many complex
              genetic diseases exhibit variation in age at onset, it is
              important to have the capability to perform survival analyses on
              data collected from individuals whose observations are correlated
              due to shared genes or environment. While there are widely
              accepted methods for variance components analysis for simple
              quantitative traits, a parallel methodology for survival data has
              not been available. This manuscript outlines a method to perform
              variance component analyses under general random effects
              proportional hazards models. This method is based on a Laplace
              approximation, and makes computation for correlated time-to-event
              data feasible. The correlated frailty models described here can
              be used to perform genetic analyses, and other analyses with
              structured random effects, on age-at-onset data in a manner
              analogous to standard variance components methods for
              quantitative traits. We illustrate the use of the method by
              examining the heritability of breast cancer in a large familial

              analyses on data simulated for the Twelfth Genetic Analysis

              method for linkage analysis in a simulation study. The breast
              cancer analyses support significant heritability of disease
              age-at-onset that is of moderate size. The variance component
              linkage analyses successfully identify the location of the
              disease genes that were simulated to have a direct impact on
              age-at-onset. The methods outlined here make it possible to
              perform general variance components analyses on time-to-event

              (Acharya et al., 2016), and Granger causality (Billio et al.,

              as well as new risk measurement techniques such as Adapted
              Exposure CoVaR and Marginal Expected Shortfall (MES), we show
              that the aggregate systemic risk exposure of financial
              institutions is positively related to sovereign debt yields in
              European countries in an episodic manner, varying positively with
              the intensity of the financial crisis facing a particular nation.
              We find evidence of a simultaneous relation between systemic risk
              exposure and sovereign debt yields. This suggests that models of
              sovereign debt yields should also include the systemic risk of a
              country's financial system in order to avoid potentially
              important mis-specification errors. We find evidence that
              systemic risk of a country's financial institutions and the risk
              of sovereign governments are inter-related and shocks to these
              domestic linkages are stronger and longer lasting than
              international risk spillovers. Thus, the channel in which
              domestic sovereign debt yields can be affected by another
              nation's sovereign debt is mostly an indirect one in that shocks
              to a foreign country's government finances are transmitted to
              that country's financial system which, in turn, can spill over to
              the domestic financial system and, ultimately, have a

               Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II)
               initiatives and, thus, to deliver practical insights into MiFID
               II implementation, compliance and cost reduction MiFID II
               constitutes the backbone for the upcoming financial market
               reforms. With the first proposal of MiFID drafted in October
               2011, this regulatory framework has undergone over 2,000
               amendments. As MiFID II currently stands, this Directive
               attempts to address issues exposed by the global financial
               crisis. Design/methodology/approach -- This study, based on
               secondary research and an in-depth analysis of the MiFID II
               framework, investigates structural and technological challenges
               entailed by this Directive. The analysis is broken down into the
               following sections: technological and structural challenges;
               costs of implementation; MiFID II teams; facilitating near
               real-time regulatory reporting; increased transparency
               requirements; and information technology (IT) initiatives for
               MiFID II compliance. Findings -- MiFID II commands significant
               changes in business and operating models. With this in mind, the
               study indicates current technological and structural challenges
               faced by financial institutions and advises on ways of
               mitigating MiFID II risks. Although it is too early to assess
               the costs of implementing MiFID II, this paper suggests ways of
               reducing MiFID II-related costs. The study also advises on
               organising dedicated teams to deal with MiFID II. Furthermore,
               this paper argues that early investments in IT systems and
               processes would allow financial services firms to gain a
               competitive advantage and, hence, scoop up market share or
               launch new, lucrative services -- especially in the area of
               collateralisation and market data processing. Originality/value
               -- This paper shows that the current version of MiFID II still
               requires a great deal of attention from the regulators that need
               to readdress contentious issues revolving around the links
               between MiFID II and other regulatory frameworks such as
               European Market Infrastructure Regulation and Dodd--Frank. This
               study addresses the MiFID II compliance issues by adopting
               European Union and non-European Union banks' and asset managers'
               perspectives and, hence, delivers practical implications for
               risk managers and compliance officers of various financial

               impact. Numbers of business service firms, most of which are
               small independent companies, have grown much faster than
               consumer service firms. Despite a significant death rate, many
               small businesses in these sectors have grown rapidly, as have
               very large firms. Business service growth has contributed
               powerfully to the UK's north?south divide, being focused on
               London and the outer South East. Possible causes of these trends

  abstract = "Abstract In this paper, we analyze the impact of business models
              on bank stability in 15 EU countries between 2002 and 2011. We
              represent banks' business models by the share of non-interest
              income in total operating income and the share of non-deposit
              funding in total liabilities. In contrast to the literature, we
              include in our sample a large number of unlisted banks, which
              represent the majority of banks in the EU. We believe this to be
              important, since many unlisted banks typically have a more
              retail-oriented business model. We show that banks will be
              significantly more stable and profitable if they increase their
              share of non-interest income, indicating that substantial
              benefits are to be gained from income diversification. Such
              benefits are particularly large for savings and cooperative
              banks. Investment banks, in contrast, become significantly more
              risky. Diversifying into non-deposit funding has a different
              impact as well. While retail-oriented banks will be significantly
              less stable if they increase their share of non-deposit funding,
              investment banks will be significantly more stable. These
              findings indicate that it is important to enlarge the sample of
              banks and to include different types of banks with different
              business models in order to arrive at general conclusions about

              to obtain the shadow price of undesirable outputs, while using
              different methodological backgrounds and perspectives. The
              current study proposes a new conceptual framework and an economic

              desirable and undesirable outputs has led to a theoretical and
              methodological debate in the nonparametric literature on
              production technology and efficiency. The first main discussion
              is about the way of modeling `bad/undesirables' as inputs or
              outputs, or by transformation functions. The second debate
              concerns the implications of the weak disposability assumption in
              the modeling of bad outputs, in particular the possibility of
              assigning unexpected signs to shadow prices of bad outputs. In
              addition, we point out a current error in the modeling of weak
              disposability under a variable returns to scale technology. In
              this paper we introduce a hybrid model to ensure the economically

               business scholars, to examine the factors that propel MNEs
               toward, or away from, ``global cities''. We argue that three
               distinctive characteristics of global cities -- global
               interconnectedness, cosmopolitanism, and abundance of advanced
               producer services -- help MNEs overcome the costs of doing
               business abroad, and we identify the contingencies under which
               these characteristics combine with firm attributes to exert
               their strongest influence. Consistent with these arguments, our
               analysis of a large sample of MNE location decisions using a
               multilevel multinomial model suggests not only that MNEs have a
               strong propensity to locate within global cities, but also that

              the inference tools to do this under general conditions, and it
              can also be used as a simple graphical device. We apply our
              method to measure directional predictability and to test the
              hypothesis that a given time series has no directional
              predictability. The test is based on comparing the correlogram of
              quantile hits to a pointwise confidence interval or on comparing
              the cumulated squared autocorrelations with the corresponding
              critical value. We provide the distribution theory needed to
              conduct inference, propose some model free upper bound critical
              values, and apply our methods to S\&P500 stock index return data.
              The empirical results suggest some directional predictability in
              returns. The evidence is strongest in mid range quantiles like
              5--10\% and for daily data. The evidence for predictability at

              asymptotic distribution of the cross-quantilogram and the
              corresponding test statistic. The limiting distributions depend
              on nuisance parameters. To construct consistent confidence

              establish consistency of this bootstrap. Also, we consider a

               long-term contrarian is entirely attributable to the classic
               January size effect, rather than to investor overreaction, as
               argued by De Bondt and Thaler (1985). Further, the paper also
               resolves the Novy-Marx (2011) concern about whether return
               autocorrelation ``is really momentum'' by demonstrating that the
               superior performance of intermediate-term momentum is due to
               strong January seasonality in the cross-section of returns. The
               implications are that long-term contrarian must be considered

               managers' efficiency, which investors either observe directly or
               infer from past performance. Momentum arises if flows exhibit
               inertia, and because rational prices underreact to expected
               future flows. Reversal arises because flows push prices away
               from fundamental values. Besides momentum and reversal, flows
               generate comovement, lead-lag effects, and amplification, with
               these being larger for high idiosyncratic risk assets. A
               calibration of our model using evidence on mutual fund returns

               function often used in neural networks with an exponential
               function, a neural network can be formed which computes
               nonlinear decision boundaries. This technique yields decision
               surfaces which approach the Bayes optimal under certain
               conditions. There is a continuous control of the linearity of
               the decision boundaries, from linear for small training sets to
               any degree of nonlinearity justified by larger training sets. A
               four-layer neural network of the type proposed can map any input
               pattern to any number of classifications. The input variables
               can be either continuous or binary. Modification of the decision
               boundaries based on new data can be accomplished in real time
               simply by defining a set of weights equal to the new training
               vector. The decision boundaries can be implemented using analog
               'neurons', which operate entirely in parallel. The organization
               proposed takes into account the projected pin limitations of
               neural-net chips of the near future. By a change in
               architecture, these same components could be used as associative
               memories, to compute nonlinear multivariate regression surfaces,

               equal in magnitude to those that have been reported in stocks.

  abstract  = "Abstract To an increasing extent over the past decade, software
               learning methods including neural networks have been used for
               prediction in financial markets and other areas. By far the most
               popular type of neural network has been backpropagation.
               However, the advantages of other learning techniques such as the
               swift response of the probabilistic neural network (PNN) suggest
               the desirability of adapting other models to the predictive
               function. Unfortunately, the conventional architecture for
               probabilistic neural networks yields only a bipolar output
               corresponding to Yes or No; Up or Down. This limitation may be
               circumvented in part by using a graded forecast of multiple
               discrete values. More specifically, the approach involves an
               architecture comprising an array of elementary PNNs with bipolar
               output. This paper explores a number of interrelated topics: (1)
               presentation of a new architecture for graded forecasting using
               an arrayed probabilistic network (APN); (2) use of a ``mistake
               chart'' to compare the accuracy of learning systems against
               default performance based on a constant prediction; and (3)
               evaluation of several backpropagation models against a recurrent
               neural network (RNN) as well as PNN, APN, and case based
               reasoning. These concepts are investigated against the backdrop

               stochastic time-varying coefficient models as vehicles for
               modelling structural change in the macroeconomy with a focus on
               the estimation of the unobserved paths of random coefficient
               processes. The dominant estimation methods, in this context, are
               based on various filters, such as the Kalman filter, that are
               applicable when the models are cast in state space
               representations. This paper introduces a new class of
               autoregressive bounded processes that decompose a time series
               into a persistent random attractor, a time varying
               autoregressive component, and martingale difference errors. The
               paper examines, rigorously, alternative kernel based,
               nonparametric estimation approaches for such models and derives
               their basic properties. These estimators have long been studied
               in the context of deterministic structural change, but their use
               in the presence of stochastic time variation is novel. The

               global asset allocation between equities, bonds, commodities and

               risk-adjusted performance compared to buy-and-hold portfolios
               and a superior method of asset allocation than risk parity. We
               believe the discipline of trend following overcomes many of the
               behavioural biases investors succumb to, such as regret and
               herding, and offers a solution to the inappropriate sequence of
               returns which can be problematic for decumulation portfolios.
               The other side of behavioural biases is that they may be
               exploited by investors: an example is momentum investing where
               herding leads to continuation of returns and has been identified
               across many assets. Momentum and trend following differ as the
               former is a relative concept and the latter absolute. Combining
               both can achieve the higher return levels associated with
               momentum portfolios with much reduced volatility and drawdowns
               due to trend following. Measures based on utility of a
               representative investor reinforce the superiority of combining
               trend following with momentum strategies. These techniques help

               dependence (or lack thereof) in asset returns, (2) dependence
               (and hence forecastability) in asset return signs, and (3)
               dependence (and hence forecastability) in asset return
               volatilities. We show that they are very much interrelated and
               explore the relationships in detail. Among other things, we show
               that (1) volatility dependence produces sign dependence, so long
               as expected returns are nonzero, so that one should expect sign
               dependence, given the overwhelming evidence of volatility
               dependence; (2) it is statistically possible to have sign
               dependence without conditional mean dependence; (3) sign
               dependence is not likely to be found via analysis of sign
               autocorrelations, runs tests, or traditional market timing tests
               because of the special nonlinear nature of sign dependence, so
               that traditional market timing tests are best viewed as tests
               for sign dependence arising from variation in expected returns
               rather than from variation in volatility or higher moments; (4)
               sign dependence is not likely to be found in very high-frequency
               (e.g., daily) or very low-frequency (e.g., annual) returns;
               instead, it is more likely to be found at intermediate return
               horizons; and (5) the link between volatility dependence and
               sign dependence remains intact in conditionally non-Gaussian

               returns under the majority of implementations evaluated but that
               time-series momentum is clearly superior. An important
               difference between the two momentum strategies is that with
               time-series momentum, the number of stocks included in the
               winner and loser portfolios vary with the state of the market.
               As a consequence, cross-sectional momentum digs deeper to select
               winning stocks when markets are weak and deeper to select losing
               stocks when markets are strong. As the information in the
               momentum signals is concentrated in the tails of the return
               distribution, it is not that surprising that momentum is best
               implemented using time-series momentum.",

               jointly exploit momentum and reversal signals in commodity
               futures. While the single-sort momentum strategies returns
               11.14\% per annum, on average, a consistent reversal pattern of
               momentum profits is pronounced from 12 to 30months after
               portfolio formation. Combining the observed reversal pattern
               with the momentum signal, our double-sort strategy returns
               20.24\% per annum, which significantly outperforms single-sort
               strategies. The proposed strategy is robust to seasonality
               effects and sample adjustments in commodity futures. The
               profitability of the double-sort strategy cannot be explained by
               standard risk factors, term structure, market volatility,

               appears to be related to global funding liquidity. As a

               Desirable outputs are produced by transforming inputs via the
               conventional transformation function, whereas (consistent with
               the material balance condition) undesirable outputs are
               by-produced via the so-called ``residual generation

               outputs from that of desirable outputs, not only do we ensure
               that undesirable outputs are not modeled as inputs and thus
               satisfy costly disposability, but we are also able to

              the United Kingdom economy. The estimated optimal tangible common

              processes which have somehow made the world a better place. Prior
              to the global financial crisis, many viewed financial innovation
              as unequivocally falling into this category. Underpinning this
              view was a pervasive belief in the self-correcting nature of
              markets and their consequent optimality as mechanisms for
              allocating society's resources. This belief exerted a profound
              influence on how we regulated financial markets and
              institutions.This paper examines the influence of this market
              fundamentalist thinking on the regulation of OTC derivatives
              markets in the US during the pivotal period between the enactment

              process in which firms intend to produce outputs (which we label
              as desirable/good) but the production process is such that it
              automatically produces some other unintentional but inevitable
              undesirable (bad) outputs as by-products (emission of
              pollutants). Like stochastic production frontier, by-production
              technology specifies that there is a minimal amount of the
              by-product that is produced, given the quantities of inputs and
              desirable outputs. The presence of (environmental) inefficiency
              in by-production therefore means that more than this minimal
              amount of the undesirable output is produced. Similarly, the
              presence of technical inefficiency implies that, given inputs,
              less than the maximal possible amount of desirable outputs is
              produced. Alternatively, it means that more than the minimal
              amounts of inputs are used to produce a given level of desirable
              output. We use the ``by-production technology'' approach which is
              a composition of production technology of desirable outputs and
              the technology of by-products, and estimate both technical and
              environmental efficiency. Given that electricity, the good output
              in our application, is demand determined, we treat it as
              exogenous and address the endogeneity of inputs by using the
              first-order conditions of cost minimization. Some of our models
              automatically take endogeneity of bad outputs into account. We
              use an efficient Bayesian MCMC technique to estimate both good
              and bad output technologies and both types of inefficiency. We
              also compare results with some alternative models with and

              has been a catalyst for extensive transformation of financial

              that there are prohibitive regulatory barriers for de novo
              entrants with limited resources to introduce discontinuous
              technological innovations and novel business models in finance.
              We challenge this notion by studying the techno-social
              transformative process of the first decade of OM, a Swedish de
              novo entrant that introduced the world's first commercially
              successful electronic options exchange and the first for-profit
              exchange. Our analysis reveals that this entrant had a key role
              in both the technological and regulatory construction of the new
              market through a bricolage technological development process and
              behaved as a proactive corporate political entrepreneur (CPE).
              The first phase of the era of ferment in electronic exchange
              technology was characterized by an adaptive techno-social
              development context that was open for bricolage technological and
              business-model experimentation. In the second phase, these
              experimental lessons were connected to a deliberative regulatory
              process that enabled the entrant to influence the regulatory
              process. We conclude by suggesting that an entrant's dual roles
              as a bricolage technological entrepreneur and as a CPE provide an

              associated `technological arms race' has created a new market
              ecology which has made trading cheaper and faster but more
              volatile and fragmented. This paper charts the technological
              roots of this transformation from a conventional measurement of
              innovation perspective. We do so by employing content analysis
              techniques and extracting market infrastructure patent counts
              from the USPTO (United States Patent and Trademark Office)
              database for the period January 1976 to October 2013. From the
              resulting time series and a qualitative examination of patents we
              find that (1) the number of market infrastructure patents has
              dramatically increased since 1999, as confirmed by an associated
              structural break; (2) the new market ecology has, in true
              Schumpeterian style, been associated with a new breed of firms,
              most notably software firms and historically smaller brokerage
              firms that have invested heavily in technology internally and

              gives banks incentives to herd and increases the risk that many
              banks may fail together. The ex-post optimal regulation may thus
              be time-inconsistent or sub-optimal from an ex-ante standpoint.
              In contrast to the too-big-to-fail problem which mainly affects

              Credit Default Swaps (CDS) and issuing Collateralized Loan
              Obligations (CLOs). After their first usage of either risk
              transfer method, the share price beta of these banks increases
              significantly. This suggests the market anticipated the risks
              arising from these methods, long before the crisis. We
              additionally separate this beta effect into a volatility and a

               points. First, from a normative perspective, the model defines
               the fundamental market failure to be addressed, namely, that
               unregulated private money creation can lead to an externality in
               which intermediaries issue too much short-term debt and leave
               the system excessively vulnerable to costly financial crises.
               Second, it shows how in a simple economy where commercial banks
               are the only lenders, conventional monetary policy tools such as
               open-market operations can be used to regulate this externality,
               whereas in more advanced economies it may be helpful to
               supplement monetary policy with other measures. Third, from a
               positive perspective, the model provides an account of how
               monetary policy can influence bank lending and real activity,

               theories of shadow banking, I inquire into its structural role
               in contemporary capitalism. My main premise here is that the
               crisis of 2007?9 is distinct in financial history because it did
               not centre on any organised market. Rather, it was crisis of the
               overcrowded financial channels bridging the present and the
               future, which have become congested because of the massive
               concentration of financial values generated, yet not sustained,
               through the shadow banking network. My analysis suggests that
               shadow banking has determined the nature of financial crisis of
               2007?9 and continues to play a necessary role in financial
               capitalism based on futurity. Drawing on scholarship in

              cheaper and more integrated, yet at the same time market
              liquidity has become more fragmented and opaque. Further, there
              are concerns that this new paradigm leads to greater volatility
              and myopia in the core function of finance (raising capital for
              entrepreneurial activity). Capital markets are clearly complex
              adaptive techno-social systems that are undergoing dramatic
              changes yet they are rarely researched from an innovation
              research or technological change perspective. In this editorial,
              we introduce the themes and issues highlighted by the papers in
              this Special Issue that addresses this gap in the literature. The
              contributions illuminate the technologies and related innovations
              that are changing the nature of capital markets. However,
              technology cannot be seen in isolation from other forces, most
              notably regulation, organisational innovation and new entrants.
              Moreover, technology is not only changing existing markets, it is
              expanding the scope of markets. Thus we conclude that
              financialization (the process by which financial markets become
              increasingly important in the economy and society) is a
              technology enabled phenomenon --- something hitherto largely
              overlooked by the financialization literature.",

              the introduction of financial innovations in emerging economies.
              It examines the impact of increasing ICT penetration on the
              assets of exchange traded funds in Brazil, Mexico, Japan and
              South Korea and the United States over 2002--2012. The

              all countries increases in ICT penetration have been pervasive

               journals.permissions@oup.comOne of key features of capitalism as
               a form of economic organization concerns its ability to change.
               Innovation often occurs by using old things in new ways, or by
               taking pre-existing elements and rearranging them into novel
               configurations [termed `conversion' by Streeck and Thelen (2005,
               p. 26)]. Change can also happen when old activities are simply
               discontinued, or when new activities are added [what Mahoney and
               Thelen (2010, p. 16) call `layering']. Capitalist innovation
               does not arise ex nihilo, nor does it involve wholesale
               rejection of the past. As even casual students of contemporary
               capitalism realize, much of today's capitalism resembles the
               old-fashioned kind studied by nineteenth-century social
               theorists like Marx, Durkheim and Weber. Heavy industry still

              attention in management and organization studies and gaining
              prominence because of its capacity to capture the interstitial
              and temporary elements of organizing and work. The authors
              present a systematic review of the literature on liminality,
              covering 61 published papers, and undertake a critical analysis
              of how the concept of liminality has been used in prior research.
              This review reveals associations with three main themes: process;
              position; and place. For each theme, the authors identify the
              central research questions posed, while comparing individual and
              collective levels of analysis. During this process, the authors
              revisit several ideas central to the original, anthropological
              research on liminality, a perspective from which they suggest a
              rejuvenation of liminality research in management and
              organization studies. This paper argues for a greater focus on
              the liminal experience itself -- especially its ritual and
              temporal dimensions -- and for improving the comparative analysis
              of liminality following the three themes identified in this
              paper. The authors suggest that revising the agenda for
              liminality research along these lines could facilitate more
              informed responses to the challenges of an increasingly temporary
              and dynamic work life.",

  abstract = "Abstract Common asset holdings are widely believed to have been
              the primary vector of contagion in the recent financial crisis.
              We develop a network approach to the amplification of financial
              contagion due to the combination of overlapping portfolios and
              leverage, and we show how it can be understood in terms of a
              generalized branching process. This can be used to compute the
              stability for any particular configuration of portfolios. By
              studying a stylized model we estimate the circumstances under
              which systemic instabilities are likely to occur as a function of
              parameters such as leverage, market crowding, diversification,
              and market impact. Although diversification may be good for
              individual institutions, it can create dangerous systemic
              effects, and as a result financial contagion gets worse with too
              much diversification. There is a critical threshold for leverage;
              below it financial networks are always stable, and above it the
              unstable region grows as leverage increases. Note that our model
              assumes passive portfolio management during a crisis; however, we
              show that dynamic deleveraging during a crisis can amplify
              instabilities. The financial system exhibits ``robust yet
              fragile'' behavior, with regions of the parameter space where
              contagion is rare but catastrophic whenever it occurs. Our model
              and methods of analysis can be calibrated to real data and

               the idealized picture of a frictionless and self-equilibrating
               market offered by the typical finance textbook. Market Liquidity
               offers a more accurate and authoritative take on liquidity and
               price discovery. The authors start from the assumption that not
               everyone is present at all times simultaneously on the market,
               and that even the limited number of participants who are have
               quite diverse information about the security's fundamentals. As
               a result, the order flow is a complex mix of information and
               noise, and a consensus price only emerges gradually over time as
               the trading process evolves and the participants interpret the
               actions of other traders. Thus a security's actual transaction
               price may deviate from its fundamental value, as it would be
               assessed by a fully informed set of investors. This book takes
               these deviations seriously, and explains why and how they emerge
               in the trading process and are eventually eliminated. The
               authors draw on a vast body of theoretical insights and
               empirical findings on security price formation that have
               accumulated in the last thirty years, and have come to form a
               well-defined field within financial economics known as 'market
               microstructure.' Focusing on liquidity and price discovery, they
               analyze the tension between the two, pointing out that when
               price-relevant information reaches the market through trading
               pressure rather than through a public announcement, liquidity
               suffers. The book also confronts many puzzling phenomena in
               securities markets and uses the analytical tools and empirical
               methods of market microstructure to understand them. These
               include issues such as why liquidity changes over time, why
               large trades move prices up or down, and why these price changes
               are subsequently reversed, why we see concentration of
               securities trading, why some traders willingly disclose their
               intended trades while others hide them, and why we observe
               temporary deviations from arbitrage prices.",

               largest banks before the crisis of 2008. We show theoretically
               that a bank's use of the loophole reveals its private compliance
               cost, which takes into account both the costs of issuing equity
               and the effectiveness of capital regulation. We find that

               Second, the responses to changes in macroprudential tools differ
               among banks, depending on their specific balance sheet

               affected by these motivations; at the same time, we investigate
               whether participants are willing to explicitly pay a small sum

               control, or more frequent feedback/opportunities to choose the
               investment level. First, the observed preference for ``control''
               did not affect investment behavior and in fact disappeared when
               participants were asked to actually pay to gain more control.
               Second, while people were indeed willing to pay for less

               and Scholes option pricing model can be explained by Bayesian
               learning effects. In the context of an equilibrium model where
               dividend news evolve on a binomial lattice with unknown but
               recursively updated probabilities we derive closed-form pricing
               formulas for European options. Learning is found to generate
               asymmetric skews in the implied volatility surface and
               systematic patterns in the term structure of option prices. Data
               on S\&P 500 index option prices is used to back out the

               cannot generate new data sets on which to test hypotheses
               independently of the data that may have led to a particular
               theory. The common practice of using the same data set to
               formulate and test hypotheses introduces data-mining biases
               that, if not accounted for, invalidate the assumptions
               underlying classical statistical inference. A striking example
               of a data-driven discovery is the presence of calendar effects
               in stock returns. There appears to be very substantial evidence
               of systematic abnormal stock returns related to the day of the

               search preceding it. In this paper we use 100 years of daily

               measure the distortions in statistical inference induced by data
               mining. We find that although nominal p-values for individual
               calendar rules are extremely significant, once evaluated in the

                   only partially observed, but can be modeled as a function of
                   an action and an observed context. This setting, known as
                   contextual bandits, encompasses a wide variety of
                   applications including health-care policy and Internet
                   advertising. A central task is evaluation of a new policy
                   given historic data consisting of contexts, actions and
                   received rewards. The key challenge is that the past data
                   typically does not faithfully represent proportions of
                   actions taken by a new policy. Previous approaches rely
                   either on models of rewards or models of the past policy.
                   The former are plagued by a large bias whereas the latter
                   have a large variance. In this work, we leverage the
                   strength and overcome the weaknesses of the two approaches
                   by applying the doubly robust technique to the problems of
                   policy evaluation and optimization. We prove that this
                   approach yields accurate value estimates when we have either
                   a good (but not necessarily consistent) model of rewards or
                   a good (but not necessarily consistent) model of past
                   policy. Extensive empirical comparison demonstrates that the
                   doubly robust approach uniformly improves over existing
                   techniques, achieving both lower variance in value
                   estimation and better policies. As such, we expect the
                   doubly robust approach to become common practice.",

                   treatment assignment be as good as random conditional on
                   pre-treatment variables. The unconfoundedness assumption is
                   often more plausible if a large number of pre-treatment
                   variables are included in the analysis, but this can worsen
                   the performance of standard approaches to treatment effect
                   estimation. In this paper, we develop a method for
                   de-biasing penalized regression adjustments to allow sparse

                   with technical debt, and no general system exists that
                   supports them completely. We address this and create the
                   first general system for contextual learning, called the
                   Decision Service. Existing systems often suffer from
                   technical debt that arises from issues like incorrect data
                   collection and weak debuggability, issues we systematically

                   The Decision Service enables all aspects of contextual
                   bandit learning using four system abstractions which connect
                   together in a loop: explore (the decision space), log,

                   applications in tech support and machine failure handling.
                   The service makes real-time decisions and learns

               most innovative financial products listed on exchanges. As
               reflected by the size of the market, they have become popular
               among both retail and institutional investors. The original ETFs
               were simple and easy to understand; however, recent products,
               such as leveraged, inverse, and synthetic ETFs, are more complex
               and have additional dimensions of risk. The additional risks,
               complexity, and reduced transparency have resulted in heightened
               attention by regulators. This chapter aims to increase
               understanding of how ETFs function in the market and can
               potentially impact financial stability and market volatility.
               Design/methodology/approach We discuss the evolution of ETFs,
               growing regulatory concerns, and the various responses to these
               concerns. Findings We find that concerns related to systemic
               risk and excess volatility, suitability for retail investors,
               lack of transparency and liquidity, securities lending and
               counterparty exposure are being addressed by both market

              the Swiss Stock Exchange offered by the leading providers in
              Europe. 35 equity ETFs are used in the sample. For both types of
              funds the average tracking error is estimated in four ways. The
              research demonstrates that both traditional and synthetic ETFs
              have significant tracking errors. The findings also show that,
              contrary to popular opinion, synthetic ETFs have higher tracking

               proxy measures for pressure, opportunity, and rationalization

               a spread estimator as a function of high--low ratios over 1-day
               and 2-day intervals. The estimator is easy to calculate, can be

               in the context of an asset market bubble. This technique, which

               existence of a bubble, provides a method for identifying not

               explosiveness is detected ranging from 1996Q2 to 2007Q2.
               Interestingly, the explosiveness is stronger in the late 1990s
               and early 2000s. For Northern Ireland, the analysis identifies a
               short yet intense bubble when the market in the Republic had

              predict the performance of companies when assessing corporate
              applicants for loans. One solution is to use Data Envelopment
              Analysis (DEA) to evaluate multiple decision-making units (DMUs

               in place in the early nineteenth century in the two countries.
               The Canadian concentrated banking system that had evolved by the
               end of the twentieth century had absorbed the key sources of
               systemic risk-the mortgage market and investment banking-and was
               tightly regulated by one overarching regulator. In contrast, the
               relatively weak, fragmented, and crisis-prone US banking system
               that had evolved since the early nineteenth century led to the
               rise of securities markets, investment banks, and money market
               mutual funds (the shadow banking system) combined with multiple
               competing regulatory authorities. The consequence was that the
               systemic risk that led to the crisis of 2007-8 was not
               contained. \copyright{} Economic History Society 2014.",

              than 5€/tCO2 in mid-2013. The sharp and persistent price decline
              has sparked intense debates both in academia and among
              policy-makers about the decisive allowance price drivers. In this
              paper we examine whether and to what extent the EUA price drop
              can be justified by three commonly identified explanatory
              factors: the economic recession, renewable policies and the use

              variations in economic activity and the growth of wind and solar

              90\% of the variations of EUA price changes remains unexplained

              event study methodology to examine the abnormal returns in crude
              oil spot and futures markets around OPEC conference and SPR
              announcement dates between 1983 and 2008. Our findings regarding
              OPEC announcements indicate an asymmetry in that only OPEC
              production cut announcements yield a statistically significant
              impact with the impact diminishing for longer maturities. We also
              find that the persistence of returns following OPEC production
              cut announcements creates substantial excess returns to investors
              who take long positions on the day following the end of OPEC
              conferences. In the case of SPR announcements, we find that the
              government's use of this program initiates a short-run market
              reaction following the announcement date. Furthermore, our tests
              of cumulative abnormal returns suggest that the market reacts
              efficiently to SPR announcements providing support for the use of
              the strategic reserves as a tool to stabilize the oil market. Our

              announcements on the conditional expectations and volatility of
              crude oil markets in the presence of long memory and structural
              changes. To do so, we first discern OPEC's oil production
              behavior in response to its ``cut'', ``maintain'', and
              ``increase'' decisions. Then by applying the ARMA--GARCH class
              models to the two global benchmarks WTI and Brent over the period
              May 1987 through December 2012, we find strong evidence of long
              memory. The empirical evidence also shows that OPEC's
              announcements especially the ``cut'' and the ``maintain''
              decisions have a significant effect on both returns and
              volatility of the crude oil markets, particularly that of the

              changes reduces the degree of volatility persistence and enhances
              the understanding of this volatility in the oil markets. These

              funding cost and its lending growth. In a cross-country
              bank-level study, we find that a 1 percentage point increase in
              the equity-to-total assets ratio is associated with a four basis
              point reduction in the cost of debt financing and with a 0.6

              in 2011 was accompanied by criticism that they would have an
              adverse effect on competitive balance in European football.
              Counter-points were also expressed, suggesting that the opposite
              would occur; that they would actually increase competitive
              balance through reducing the importance of financial power. The
              lack of clarity and cohesion on this issue prompted this paper.
              The purpose of this paper is to examine the effect FFP has had on
              competitive balance in the English Premier League.
              Design/methodology/approach The analysis conducted uses the
              Herfindahl Index of Competitive Balance as the primary method,
              and is supported by standard deviation of points analysis and a
              Scully-Noll ratio analysis, which together provide an indication
              of the level of competitive balance for each of the past 21
              seasons, from 1995/1996 to 2015/2016. This examination allows for
              the trends in competitive balance to be identified, with emphasis
              drawn on the seasons after the introduction of the regulations.
              Findings The results provide no indication that FFP regulations
              have resulted in a decline in competitive balance in the EPL,
              instead hinting that a positive effect may have been caused. This
              positive effect exceeds the primary aim of the regulations and

              football. Originality/value While underlining the need for

              insights into the effects of FFP regulations on competitive
              balance in the EPL. These insights would support the view that
              FFP initiatives have begun to shift the focus of sporting

  abstract  = "ABSTRACTMany scientific and engineering challenges?ranging from
               personalized medicine to customized marketing
               recommendations?require an understanding of treatment effect
               heterogeneity. In this article, we develop a nonparametric
               causal forest for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects
               that extends Breiman?s widely used random forest algorithm. In
               the potential outcomes framework with unconfoundedness, we show
               that causal forests are pointwise consistent for the true
               treatment effect and have an asymptotically Gaussian and
               centered sampling distribution. We also discuss a practical
               method for constructing asymptotic confidence intervals for the
               true treatment effect that are centered at the causal forest
               estimates. Our theoretical results rely on a generic Gaussian
               theory for a large family of random forest algorithms. To our
               knowledge, this is the first set of results that allows any type
               of random forest, including classification and regression
               forests, to be used for provably valid statistical inference. In
               experiments, we find causal forests to be substantially more

               conducting hypothesis tests about the magnitude of differences
               in treatment effects across subsets of the population. We
               provide a data-driven approach to partition the data into
               subpopulations that differ in the magnitude of their treatment
               effects. The approach enables the construction of valid
               confidence intervals for treatment effects, even with many
               covariates relative to the sample size, and without ``sparsity''
               assumptions. We propose an ``honest'' approach to estimation,
               whereby one sample is used to construct the partition and
               another to estimate treatment effects for each subpopulation.
               Our approach builds on regression tree methods, modified to
               optimize for goodness of fit in treatment effects and to account
               for honest estimation. Our model selection criterion anticipates
               that bias will be eliminated by honest estimation and also
               accounts for the effect of making additional splits on the
               variance of treatment effect estimates within each
               subpopulation. We address the challenge that the ``ground
               truth'' for a causal effect is not observed for any individual
               unit, so that standard approaches to cross-validation must be
               modified. Through a simulation study, we show that for our
               preferred method honest estimation results in nominal coverage
               for 90\% confidence intervals, whereas coverage ranges between
               74\% and 84\% for nonhonest approaches. Honest estimation
               requires estimating the model with a smaller sample size; the
               cost in terms of mean squared error of treatment effects for our
               preferred method ranges between 7-22\%.",

                 institutions to being subsidiaries of increasingly complex
                 financial conglomerates. We conjecture and provide evidence
                 that the organizational complexity of the family of a bank is
                 a fundamental driver of the business model of the bank itself,
                 as reflected in the management of the bank's own balance
                 sheet. Using micro-data on global banks with branch operations
                 in the United States, we show that branches of conglomerates
                 in more complex families have a markedly lower lending
                 sensitivity to funding shocks. The balance sheet management
                 strategies of banks are very much determined by the structure
                 of the organizations the banks belong to. The complexity of
                 the conglomerate can change the scale of the lending channel
                 for a large global bank by more than 30 percent.",

  abstract  = "The financial crisis of 2007-2009 revealed that the corporate
               complexity of most of the Global Systemically Important Banks
               (G-SIBs) presented a formidable obstacle to any plausible
               orderly resolution of these institutions. This paper documents
               the extent of this complexity making use of an historical time
               series, developed by the authors, that shows the evolution of
               the number of majority-owned subsidiaries of G-SIBs over time.
               After a very significant increase in complexity before the
               crisis and until 2011, this trend may be reversing, possibly in
               response to regulatory and market pressures on banks since then.
               Nonetheless the reduction in complexity has been uneven across
               institutions and may not persist. The econometric analysis of
               this new set of panel data produces two key results with
               relevant policy implications: first, the relationship found in
               previous studies between the number of subsidiaries and bank
               size loses significance when time effects are introduced;
               second, large mergers and acquisitions are a key driver of
               complexity and their effect remains significant even when time
               effects are considered.",

               The shadow banking system consists of a web of specialized

               intertwined with core regulated institutions such as bank
               holding companies, security brokers and dealers, and insurance
               companies. These interconnections of shadow banks with other

               robust across measures of lobbying and accounts for endogeneity

               addition, I show that lobbying banks are riskier and reliably
               underperform their nonlobbying peers. Overall, these results
               appear rather inconsistent with an information-based explanation
               of bank lobbying, but consistent with the theory of regulatory

               it implies a lack of rationality that is alien to economists.
               This paper reviews survey questions regarding people's reactions

               the psychology that underlies money illusion. We propose that

               and real terms, and that money illusion arises from an

               (people, devices, products) respond differently to the

               nonparametric analysis of such heterogenous treatment effects
               and their measurement in relation to observable covariates. New
               results and algorithms are provided for quantifying the

               both linear projections and nonlinear regression trees (CART and

               leads to results that are mostly in agreement with those from
               the frequentist literature. We find that linear regression
               adjustment of treatment effect averages (i.e.,
               post-stratification) can provide some variance reduction, but
               that this reduction will be vanishingly small in the low-signal
               and large-sample setting of digital experiments. For regression
               trees, we provide uncertainty quantification for the machine
               learning algorithms that are commonly applied in tree-fitting.
               We argue that practitioners should look to ensembles of trees
               (forests) rather than individual trees in their analysis. The

               change models, common breaks that occur in all equations, breaks
               that occur in a subset of equations, and so forth. The method of
               estimation is quasi-maximum likelihood based on Normal errors.
               The limiting distributions are obtained under more general
               assumptions than previous studies. For testing, we propose
               likelihood ratio type statistics to test the null hypothesis of

               Structural change tests with restrictions on the parameters can
               be constructed to achieve higher power when prior information is
               present. For computation, an algorithm for an efficient

              are a subject of public and regulatory concern. This paper
              addresses this issue by using a case study of Spain, where the
              retail banking market was split evenly between shareholder and
              stakeholder banks before the crisis. We examine how institutional
              diversity mattered in the accumulation of risk in the pre-crisis
              years, in the severity of losses caused by the crisis, and in the
              resilience to recover from the losses. The method of analysis
              consists in linking the risk position of the banks in the
              pre-crisis period and the losses arising during the crisis to the
              decisions of banks to migrate from business models based on
              deposit financing to models based on market-debt financing. We
              find that cajas migrated to more vulnerable business models
              following the strategy of the shareholder banks, but the losses
              in the crisis were much higher in the former than in the latter.
              The paper interprets this result as evidence that what matters

               approaches in the literature. In particular, the framework
               exhibits a ``financial accelerator'', in that endogenous
               developments in credit markets work to amplify and propagate
               shocks to the macroeconomy. In addition, we add several features
               to the model that are designed to enhance the empirical
               relevance. First, we incorporate money and price stickiness,
               which allows us to study how credit market frictions may
               influence the transmission of monetary policy. In addition, we
               allow for lags in investment which enables the model to generate
               both hump-shaped output dynamics and a lead-lag relation between
               asset prices and investment, as is consistent with the data.
               Finally, we allow for heterogeneity among firms to capture the
               fact that borrowers have differential access to capital markets.
               Under reasonable parametrizations of the model, the financial

              crude and largely limited to various forms of a pass completion
              rate. These metrics can be misleading for two general reasons:
              they do not account for the difficulty of the attempted pass nor
              the various levels of uncertainty involved in empirical
              observations based on different numbers of passes per player. We
              address both these deficiencies by building a statistical model
              in which the success of a pass depends on the skill of the
              executing player as well as other factors including the origin
              and destination of the pass, the skill of his teammates and the

              using data from the 2006--2007 season of the English Premier
              League provided by Opta, estimate each player's passing skill and

               In the Black--Scholes model, it has been recognized that
               computing a hedging position from the sensitivity of the
               calibrated model option value function is inadequate in
               minimizing variance of the option hedge risk, as it fails to
               capture the model parameter dependence on the underlying price
               (see e.g. Coleman et al., J. Risk, 2001, 5(6), 63--89; Hull and
               White, J. Bank. Finance, 2017, 82, 180--190). In this paper, we
               demonstrate that this issue can exist generally when determining
               hedging position from the sensitivity of the option function,
               either calibrated from a parametric model from current option
               prices or estimated nonparametricaly from historical option
               prices. Consequently, the sensitivity of the estimated model
               option function typically does not minimize variance of the
               hedge risk, even instantaneously. We propose a data-driven
               approach to directly learn a hedging function from the market
               data by minimizing variance of the local hedge risk. Using the
               S\&P 500 index daily option data for more than a decade ending
               in August 2015, we show that the proposed method outperforms the
               parametric minimum variance hedging method proposed in Hull and
               White [J. Bank. Finance, 2017, 82, 180--190], as well as minimum
               variance hedging corrective techniques based on stochastic
               volatility or local volatility models. Furthermore, we show that
               the proposed approach achieves significant gain over the implied

               collateral may increase, whilst collateral availability may

               collateral are likely to be comparatively benign, but that the

              and powerful tree-based techniques mainly operating on the

              2015, daily one-day-ahead trading signals are generated based on
              the probability forecast of a stock to outperform the general

              deviant behavior and its consequences. However, the way
              compliance with regulations is actually enacted or ``performed''
              within organizations instead of merely executed, remains largely
              under-characterized. Evidence from an ethnographic study in the
              compliance unit of a French investment bank allows us to develop
              a detailed practice approach to how regulation is actually
              implemented in firms. We characterize the work accomplished by
              compliance analysts who are in fact, ``curving'' the script of
              regulation within what we conceptualize as a ``comfort zone''.
              Beyond agency, ethics appears as a key element in linking the
              ``letter of the law'', which serves as a referential anchor to
              guide action, with the complex nature of specific situations. We
              analyze the way individuals and compliance teams cope with,
              interpret, struggle and in fine, perform regulation within this
              comfort zone. A particular interest is thus given to the work of
              embedded ethics in this process, as an enabler to partly recouple
              compliance with the regulated activity. We find that blind
              execution is not only impossible, but also devoid of meaning both
              from regulatory, risk management, and business perspectives in
              organizations. We highlight and characterize a hermeneutic
              dimension to this work, essential to effectively perform

               late 1980s and early 1990s, when firms were experiencing
               external pressures to adopt policies that demonstrate corporate
               control over managerial behavior. We develop theory to explain
               variation in the responses of firms to such pressures, i.e., why

               programs, while others decouple formally adopted repurchase

              general, but for banks with market power this effect
              significantly weakens or can even be reversed. Higher activity

              However, in recent years, numerous scandals involving fraud have
              undermined confidence in the financial industry. Contemporary
              commentators have attributed these scandals to the financial

              However, when their professional identity as bank employees is
              rendered salient, a significant proportion of them become

              ethnography, focused ethnography and go-along ethnography.
              Phenomenology-based ethnography has emerged from developments in
              sociology that draw on ?social phenomenology? developed by Alfred
              Sch{\"u}tz. These developments involve the use of

              these phenomenology-based methods? aims, techniques of data
              collection and analysis, and required effort. These three methods

              research has been conducted to examine the effects of feature
              construction, guided by domain knowledge, on classification
              performance. However, in many application domains, domain
              knowledge can be used to construct higher-level features to
              potentially improve performance. For example, past research and
              regulatory practice in early warning of bank failures has
              resulted in various explanatory variables, in the form of
              financial ratios, that are constructed based on bank accounting
              variables and are believed to be more effective than the original
              variables in identifying potential problem banks. In this study,
              we empirically compare the performance of two sets of classifiers
              for bank failure prediction, one built using raw accounting
              variables and the other built using constructed financial ratios.
              Four popular data mining methods are used to learn the

               selling of a bank's stocks can trigger the failure of the bank.
               In the model, creditors, who learn information from stock
               prices, will grow increasingly unsure about the bank's true
               fundamentals in facing noisier stock prices; thus a run on the
               bank is more likely because of creditors' concave payoff.
               Understanding this, speculators conduct short selling beforehand
               to amplify (il)liquidity and add noise to stock prices,
               triggering a bank run, and subsequently profit from the bank's
               failure. We show that short-selling attacks on a bank involve
               two runs: the aggressive run among speculators and the
               conservative run among creditors. These two runs interact and

              ecological systems. The concept of social-ecological resilience
              holds promise for interdisciplinary syntheses. Resilience is a
              multifaceted concept that as yet has not been directly
              operationalized, particularly in systems for which our ignorance
              is such that detailed, parameter-rich simulation models are
              difficult to develop. We present an exploratory framework as a
              step towards the operationalization of resilience for empirical
              studies. We equate resilience with the ability of a system to
              maintain its identity, where system identity is defined as a
              property of key components and relationships (networks) and their
              continuity through space and time. Innovation and memory are also
              fundamental to understanding identity and resilience. By parsing
              our systems into the elements that we subjectively consider
              essential to identity, we obtain a small set of specific focal
              variables that reflect changes in identity. By assessing the
              potential for changes in identity under specified drivers and
              perturbations, in combination with a scenario-based approach to
              considering alternative futures, we obtain a surrogate measure of
              the current resilience of our study system as the likelihood of a
              change in system identity under clearly specified conditions,
              assumptions, drivers and perturbations. Although the details of
              individual case studies differ, the concept of identity provides
              a level of generality that can be used to compare measure of

               competitions. While potential outcomes of the concept have been
               thoroughly assessed, there is little research on the genesis and
               background behind its implementation. The present paper fills
               this gap by analyzing the discourse in the run-up to the passage
               of FFP. We focus on interpreted practice and context and argue
               that the rising indebtedness of clubs and their increasing
               reliance on benefactors were a necessary but not sufficient
               requirement. Further ingredients imperative for the successful
               policy development were claims-making activities by influential
               actors to secure support for their problem perception. Strong
               discourse coalitions were formed around powerful storylines,

              analysis as alternative tools for assessing the performance of
              organisational units such as bank branches and schools. Such
              units typically use one or more resources to secure one or more
              outputs, the inputs and/or outputs being possibly incommensurate.
              The assessment of District Health Authorities in England on the
              provision of perinatal care is used as a vehicle for comparing
              the two methods. The comparison focuses on how well the two
              methods agree on the performance of a unit relative to that of
              other units, and on the estimates of targets each method provides
              for improving the performance of units. It is found that provided
              the performance indicators capture all variables used in the DEA
              assessment the two methods agree reasonably closely on the
              performance of the units as a whole, though this depends on the
              way the performance indicators are combined into a summary figure
              of performance. The two methods can disagree substantially on the
              relative performance of individual units. Ratio analysis, unlike
              DEA, is not found to be suitable for setting targets so that
              units can become more efficient. This is mainly due to the fact
              that DEA takes simultaneous account of all resources and outputs
              in assessing performance while ratio analysis relates only one
              resource to one output at a time. However, the two methods can
              support each other if used jointly. Ratios do provide useful
              information on the performance of a unit on specific aspects and
              they can support the communication of DEA results to
              non-specialists when the two methods agree on performance.",

              (open-end and closed-end funds) is recognized as one of the
              most-discussed issues in the financial industry. This is the
              first study to empirically verify and compare the diffusion and
              substitution of ETFs using monthly data on their assets in two

              in-depth insights into the development of innovative financial
              products available in two Asian economies: Japan and South Korea.
              The empirical study uses monthly total net assets data for
              2004--2017. Our methodological framework combines models of
              innovation diffusion and technological substitution. The results
              reported in the study show that in both countries the diffusion
              of ETFs has occurred. The rate of diffusion and the phase of
              growth reached differed -- in Japan the ETF market was in the
              early exponential growth stage, whereas in South Korea it was
              closer to achieving the expected maximum saturation. The results
              of the substitution analysis between the largest category of the
              innovative funds -- equity ETFs and equity open-end funds clearly
              demonstrate that the process of ``switching'' from equity
              open-end funds into ETFs may be easily traced in both countries.

              interconnections increase expected losses and defaults under a
              wide range of shock distributions. In contrast to most work on
              financial networks, we assume only minimal information about
              network structure and rely instead on information about the
              individual institutions that are the nodes of the network. The
              key node-level quantities are asset size, leverage, and a
              financial connectivity measure given by the fraction of a
              financial institution's liabilities held by other financial
              institutions. We combine these measures to derive explicit bounds

              node sizes are heterogeneous and the originating node is highly

              infectious disease incidence and prevalence, particularly among
              vulnerable groups. Using a susceptible-infected-recovered
              framework, we systematically reviewed literature on the impact of
              the economic crises on infectious disease risks in migrants in
              Europe, focusing principally on HIV, TB, hepatitis and other
              STIs. METHODS: We conducted two searches in PubMed/Medline, Web
              of Science, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, websites of key
              organizations and grey literature to identify how economic
              changes affect migrant populations and infectious disease. We
              perform a narrative synthesis in order to map critical pathways
              and identify hypotheses for subsequent research. RESULTS: The
              systematic review on links between economic crises and migrant
              health identified 653 studies through database searching; only
              seven met the inclusion criteria. Fourteen items were identified
              through further searches. The systematic review on links between
              economic crises and infectious disease identified 480 studies
              through database searching; 19 met the inclusion criteria. Eight
              items were identified through further searches. The reviews show
              that migrant populations in Europe appear disproportionately at
              risk of specific infectious diseases, and that economic crises
              and subsequent responses have tended to exacerbate such risks.
              Recessions lead to unemployment, impoverishment and other risk
              factors that can be linked to the transmissibility of disease
              among migrants. Austerity measures that lead to cuts in
              prevention and treatment programmes further exacerbate infectious
              disease risks among migrants. Non-governmental health service
              providers occasionally stepped in to cater to specific
              populations that include migrants. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence
              that migrants are especially vulnerable to infectious disease
              during economic crises. Ring-fenced funding of prevention
              programs, including screening and treatment, is important for
              addressing this vulnerability.",

               predict, the near collapse of the financial system and its
               long-lasting effects on the global economy. Since the 2008
               crisis, there has been increasing interest in using ideas from
               complexity theory to make sense of economic and financial
               markets. Concepts such as tipping points, networks, contagion,
               feedback, and resilience have entered the financial and
               regulatory lexicon, but actual use of complexity models and
               results remains at an early stage. Recent insights and
               techniques offer potential for better monitoring and management
               of highly interconnected economic and financial systems and,
               thus, may help anticipate and manage future crises. TIPPING
               POINTS, WARNING SIGNALS. Financial markets have historically
               exhibited sudden and largely unforeseen collapses, at a systemic
               scale. Such ``phase transitions'' may in some cases have been
               triggered by unpredictable stochastic events. More often,
               however, there have been endogenous underlying processes at
               work. Analyses of complex systems ranging from the climate to
               ecosystems reveal that, before a major transition, there is
               often a gradual and unnoticed loss of resilience. This makes the
               system brittle: A small disruption can trigger a domino effect
               that propagates through the system and propels it into a crisis
               state. Recent research has revealed generic empirical
               quantitative indicators of resilience that may be used across
               complex systems to detect tipping points. Markers include rising
               correlation between nodes in a network and rising temporal
               correlation, variance, and skewedness of fluctuation patterns.
               These indicators were first predicted mathematically and
               subsequently demonstrated experimentally in real complex
               systems, including living systems ([ 1 ][1]). A recent study of
               the Dutch interbank network ([ 2 ][2]) showed that standard
               analysis using a homogeneous network model could only lead to
               late detection of the 2008 crisis, although a more realistic and
               heterogeneous network model could identify an early warning
               signal 3 years before the crisis (see the chart). Ecologists
               have developed tools to quantify the stability, robustness, and
               resilience of food webs and have shown how these depend on the
               topology of the network and the strengths of interactions ([ 3
               ][3]). Epidemiologists have tools to gauge the potential for
               events to propagate in systems of interacting entities, to
               identify superspreaders and core groups relevant to infection
               persistence, and to design strategies to prevent or limit the
               spread of contagion ([ 4 ][4]). Extrapolating results from the
               natural sciences to economics and finance presents challenges.
               For instance, publication of an early warning signal will change
               behavior and affect future dynamics [the Lucas critique ([ 5
               ][5])]. But this does not affect the case where indicators are
               known only to regulators or when the goal is to build better
               network barriers to slow contagion. TOO CENTRAL TO FAIL. Network
               effects matter to financial-economic stability because shock
               amplification may occur via strong cascading effects. For
               example, the Bank of International Settlements recently
               developed a framework drawing on data on the interconnectedness
               between banks to gauge the systemic risk posed to the financial
               network by Global Systemically Important Banks. Recent research
               on contagion in financial networks has shown that network
               topology and positions of banks matter; the global financial
               network may collapse even when individual banks appear safe ([ 6
               ][6]). Capturing these effects is essential for quantifying
               stress on individual banks and for looking at systemic risk for
               the network as a whole. Despite on-going efforts, these effects
               are unlikely to be routinely considered anytime soon.
               Information asymmetry within a network---e.g. where a bank does
               not know about troubled assets of other banks---can be
               problematic. The banking network typically displays a
               core-periphery structure, with a core consisting of a relatively
               small number of large, densely interconnected banks that are not
               very diverse in terms of business and risk models. This implies
               that core banks' defaults tend to be highly correlated. That, in
               turn, can generate a collective moral hazard problem (i.e.,
               players take on more risk, because others will bear the costs in
               case of default), as banks recognize that they are likely to be
               supported by the authorities in situations of distress, the
               likelihood amplifies their incentives to herd in the first
               place. Estimating systemic risk relies on granular data on the
               financial network. Unfortunately, business interactions between
               banks are often hidden because of confidentiality issues. Tools
               being developed to reconstruct networks from partial information
               and to estimate systemic risk ([ 7 ][7]) suggest that publicly
               available bank information does not allow reliable estimation of
               systemic risk. The estimate would improve greatly if banks
               publicly reported the number of connections with other banks,
               even without disclosing their identity. In addition to data,
               understanding the effects of interconnections also relies on
               integrative quantitative metrics and concepts that reveal
               important network aspects, such as systemic repercussions of the
               failure of individual nodes. For example, DebtRank, which
               measures the systemic importance of individual institutions in a
               financial network ([ 8 ][8]), shows that the issue of
               too-central-to-fail may be even more important than
               too-big-to-fail. AGENTS AND BEHAVIOR. Agent-based models (ABMs)
               are computer models in which the behavior of agents and their
               interactions are explicitly represented as decision rules
               mapping agents' observations onto actions. Although ABMs are
               less well established in analyzing financial-economic systems
               than in, e.g., traffic control, epidemiology, or battlefield
               conflict analyses, they have produced promising results. Axtell
               ([ 9 ][9]) developed a simple ABM that explains more than three
               dozen empirical properties of firm formation without recourse to
               external shocks. ABMs provide a good explanation for why the
               volatility of prices is clustered and time-varying ([ 10 ][10])
               and have been used to test systemic risk implications of reforms
               developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which
               show how dynamically changing risk limits can lead to booms and
               busts in prices ([ 11 ][11], [ 12 ][12]). ABMs of market
               dynamics can be linked with ABM work on opinion dynamics in the
               social sciences ([ 13 ][13]) to understand how propagation of
               opinions through social networks affects emergent macro
               behavior, which is crucial to managing the stability and
               resilience of socioeconomic systems. ![Figure][14] Early-warning
               signals of the 2008 crisis in the Dutch interbank network. The

               that are at the same time debtor and creditor to each other.
               Although the raw number of two loops is not very informative
               about possible ongoing structural changes, its comparison with a

               coincided with a severe global financial downturn (2007?8). This
               paper examines the use of ?contagion? as a model for assessing
               the dynamics of both episodes: the spread of infection and the
               diffusion of shock through an intrafinancial system. The
               argument is put that a discourse of globally ?emerging? and
               ?re-emerging? infection helped to shape a theory of financial
               contagion, which developed, particularly from 1997, in relation
               to financial crises in ?emerging markets? in Southeast Asia.
               Conversely, concerns about the economic impact of a global
               pandemic have been influential in shaping public health
               responses to communicable diseases from the early 1990s. The
               paper argues that tracing the conceptual entanglement of
               financial and biological ?contagions? is important for
               understanding the interconnected global environment within which
               risk is increasingly being evaluated. The paper also considers
               the consequences of this analogizing for how financial crises
               are understood and, ultimately, how responses to them are
               formulated.",

              (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), random forest and
              naive-Bayes with two approaches for input to these models. The
              first approach for input data involves computation of ten
              technical parameters using stock trading data (open, high, low \&
              close prices) while the second approach focuses on representing
              these technical parameters as trend deterministic data. Accuracy
              of each of the prediction models for each of the two input
              approaches is evaluated. Evaluation is carried out on 10years of
              historical data from 2003 to 2012 of two stocks namely Reliance
              Industries and Infosys Ltd. and two stock price indices CNX Nifty

              random forest outperforms other three prediction models on
              overall performance. Experimental results also show that the

              based on training a model to identify stocks with high or low
              predicted returns. A tail set is defined to be a group of stocks
              whose volatility-adjusted price change is in the highest or
              lowest quantile, for example the highest or lowest 5\%. Each
              stock is represented by a set of technical and fundamental
              features computed using CRSP and Compustat data. A classifier is
              trained on historical tail sets and tested on future data. The
              classifier is chosen to be a nonlinear support vector machine
              (SVM) due to its simplicity and effectiveness. The SVM is trained
              once per month, in order to adjust to changing market conditions.
              Portfolios are formed by ranking stocks using the classifier
              output. The highest ranked stocks are used for long positions and
              the lowest ranked ones for short sales. The Global Industry
              Classification Standard is used to build a model for each sector
              such that a total of 8 long-short portfolios for Energy,
              Materials, Industrials, Consumer Discretionary, Consumer Staples,
              Health Care, Financials, and Information Technology are formed.
              The data range from 1981 to 2010. Without measuring trading
              costs, but using 91 day holding periods to minimize these, the
              strategy leads to annual excess returns (Jensen alpha) of 15\%

               identification of a set of elementary perceptual tasks that are
               carried out when people extract quantitative information from
               graphs. The second part is an ordering of the tasks on the basis
               of how accurately people perform them. Elements of the theory
               are tested by experimentation in which subjects record their
               judgments of the quantitative information on graphs. The
               experiments validate these elements but also suggest that the
               set of elementary tasks should be expanded. The theory provides
               a guideline for graph construction: Graphs should employ
               elementary tasks as high in the ordering as possible. This
               principle is applied to a variety of graphs, including bar
               charts, divided bar charts, pie charts, and statistical maps
               with shading. The conclusion is that radical surgery on these
               popular graphs is needed, and as replacements we offer

              credit risk management by the largest US‐based financial
              institutions. Owing to the increasing variety in the types of
              counterparties and the ever‐expanding variety in the forms of
              obligations, credit risk management has jumped to the forefront
              of risk management activities carried out by firms in the
              financial services industry. This study is designed to shed light
              on the current practices of these
              firms.Design/methodology/approach -- A short questionnaire,
              containing seven questions, was mailed to each of the top 100
              banking firms headquartered in the USA.Findings -- It was found
              that identifying counterparty default risk is the single
              most‐important purpose served by the credit risk models utilized.
              Close to half of the responding institutions utilize models that
              are also capable of dealing with counterparty migration risk.
              Surprisingly, only a minority of banks currently utilize either a
              proprietary or a vendor‐marketed model for the management of
              their credit risk. Interestingly, those that utilize their own
              in‐house model also utilize a vendor‐marketed model. Not
              surprisingly, such models are more widely used for the management
              of non‐traded credit loan portfolios than they are for the
              management of traded bonds.Originality/value -- The results help
              one to understand the current practices of these firms. As such,
              they enable us to make inferences about the perceived importance
              of the risks. The paper is of particular value to the treasurers

  title    = "The Current State of Quantitative Equity Investing",
  author   = "Becker, Ying and Reinganum, Marc R",
  abstract = "Quantitative equity management is concerned with rigorous,
              disciplined approaches to help investors structure optimal
              portfolios to achieve the outcomes they seek. At the root of
              disciplined, modern investment processes are two things: risk and
              return. The notion of total return is obvious---price
              appreciation plus any dividend payments. Risk may not be so
              straightforward. In most quantitative approaches, risk is viewed
              as more akin to a roulette wheel; that is, the possible outcomes
              are well specified and the likelihood of each outcome is known,
              but in advance, an investor does not know which outcome will be
              realized. In this piece, we curate the history of quantitative
              equity investing, which traces its origins to the development of
              portfolio theory and the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). In
              equities, some of the first quantitative approaches were aimed at
              confirming the theoretical predictions of the CAPM. In
              particular, the expected return of a risky asset depends only on
              the risk of that asset as measured by its beta, a covariance
              measure of risk. In this paradigm, all investors hold the same
              risky portfolio, the market portfolio of risky assets that
              maximizes the Sharpe ratio. At the same time, stock prices are
              viewed to be informationally efficient and reflecting all
              available information. By the early 1980s, this simple view of
              the world was punctured by the discovery of stock market
              anomalies. Researchers discovered that variables other than beta
              could explain the cross section of expected returns. In
              particular, size and value were found to contain useful
              explanatory power. By the 1990s, the anomalies morphed into the
              mainstream as the anomalies were re-labeled as factors, and the
              benchmark model, at least in academic research, was a
              three-factor model with beta, size, and value. Concurrent with
              the three-factor model, other credible factors muscled their way
              into the credible empirical asset pricing world, including
              momentum, liquidity, quality, and volatility. Indeed, in 2011,
              the president of the American Finance Association described the
              proliferation of factors as a ``zoo of new factors.'' Recent work
              suggests using a much higher standard to accept new factors. With
              diminishing acceptance of the view that capitalization-weighted
              indexes are optimal for all investors, factor investing has taken
              off in practice. Sometime these ``smart factors'' are called
              smart beta. Morningstar reported that factor investing is the
              fastest-growing segment of the investment management marketplace.
              Investors have recognized that low-cost exposure to other factors
              might give them superior risk/return trade-offs. Of course,
              active investors are still looking for ways to improve
              performance over more-passive smart beta indexes. In this race,
              big data approaches offer the potential to grab an insight before
              it becomes widely known. Another promising avenue is the ability
              to dynamically adjust allocations to different factors based on
              the macroeconomic environment and investment conditions. Active
              managers are also exploring better ways to construct portfolios.
              In short, quantitative equity management is alive and well and
              intellectually active as investors seek to better manage risk and
              return. Commercially, factor investing has taken off in the form
              of smart beta. Products and strategies, vetted by decades of
              prior and current research, are continually being developed. One
              might reasonably forecast that dynamic factor-timing strategies
              will be a growth area for the quantitative equity field. A new
              generation of big data approaches is developing in the field and
              is likely to grow as technology becomes more capable and more
              data are digitally available. Despite the advances in theory,
              modeling, and technology, the goal of quantitative equity
              management techniques is an old one: aiding investors to achieve
              more efficient and appropriate investment outcomes.",

              authors point to the limits of widely used valuation techniques.
              The most important of these limits is the inability to forecast
              cash flows and to determine the appropriate discount rate.
              Another important limit is the inability to determine absolute
              value. Widely used valuation techniques such as market multiples
              - the price-to-earnings ratio, firm value multiples or a use of
              multiple ratios, for example - capture only relative value, that

              the timing of the offer, suffer from information asymmetry, and
              are more subject to behavioral elements than is the case for
              shares of listed firms. In the case of IPOs in particular, the

              may suggest a more liberal and principled approach to financial
              regulation. Disruptive innovation has the potential for welfare
              outcomes for consumers, regulatory, and supervisory gains as well
              as reputational gains for the financial services industry. It
              becomes even more important as the financial services industry
              evolves. For example, the preparedness of the regulators to
              instil culture change and harmonise technological advancements
              with regulation could likely achieve many desired outcomes. Such
              results range from achieving an orderly market growth, further
              aiding systemic stability and restoring trust and confidence in
              the financial system. Our action-led research results have
              implications for both research and practice. These should be of
              interest to regulatory standard setters, investors, international
              organisations and other academics who are researching regulatory
              and competition issues, and their manifestation within the

              Using a model in which insurers with insufficient pricing data
              cannot differentiate between low- and high-risk policyholders and
              therefore charge both the same premium, we show how innovative
              insurers develop new risk classification data to identify
              overcharged low-risk policyholders and attract them from rival
              insurers with reduced prices. Less innovative insurers thus
              insure a growing percentage of high-risk customers, resulting in
              adverse selection attributable to their informational
              disadvantage. Next, we examine two cases in which ?Big Data?
              innovations in risk classification led to concerns about cream

              Although not a substitute for the more traditional
              arbitrage-based pricing formulas, network-pricing formulas may be
              more accurate and computationally more efficient alternatives

              obtained when the option pricing function is homogeneous of
              degree one with respect to the underlying asset price (St) and
              the strike price (K). We show that pricing accuracy gains can be

              nearly doubled from 2007 to 2015, with particularly dramatic
              growth among online ``fintech'' lenders. We study how two forces,
              regulatory differences and technological advantages, contributed
              to this growth. Difference in difference tests exploiting
              geographical heterogeneity induced by four specific increases in
              regulatory burden--capital requirements, mortgage servicing
              rights, mortgage-related lawsuits, and the movement of
              supervision to Office of Comptroller and Currency following
              closure of the Office of Thrift Supervision--all reveal that
              traditional banks contracted in markets where they faced more
              regulatory constraints; shadow banks partially filled these gaps.
              Relative to other shadow banks, fintech lenders serve more
              creditworthy borrowers and are more active in the refinancing
              market. Fintech lenders charge a premium of 14--16 basis points
              and appear to provide convenience rather than cost savings to
              borrowers. They seem to use different information to set interest
              rates relative to other lenders. A quantitative model of mortgage
              lending suggests that regulation accounts for roughly 60\% of
              shadow bank growth, while technology accounts for roughly 30\%.",

              frequently motivated by the objective of promoting stability in

              better performing banks is tenuous at best. In this article, we
              investigate if this tenuous relationship could be due to the
              treatment of target and acquiring banks as the same type in
              empirical analysis, which overlooks the possibility that M\&A may
              affect these banks differently. Using panel data on six emerging
              countries, our results confirm that the effect of M\&A is
              generally weak except when our regressions are implemented
              separately for target and acquiring banks. For the latter, we
              find that target banks tend to be more efficient after an M\&A
              but no efficiency improvements are found for acquiring banks.
              These results suggest that in emerging countries, bank M\&A can
              lead to efficiency improvements for the combined entity, although
              target banks are mainly the ones to benefit from it. They also

              examines the roles and characteristics of U.S. community banks in
              the past decade, covering the recent economic boom and downturn.
              We analyze risk characteristics of acquired community banks,
              compare pre- and post-acquisition performance, and investigate
              how the acquisitions have affected SBL. Contrary to the concerns,
              our analysis shows that the overall amount of SBL increases more
              after a merger when a community bank is acquired by a large bank.
              Data also suggest an overall (regardless of mergers) declining
              SBL trend for all bank size groups. In fact, the decline in the
              SBL ratio, on average, has been more severe among community
              banks, relative to large banks. Our results indicate that mergers

              enhanced the overall safety and soundness of the banking system

              alternatives used to shore up financial institutions. We find
              that takeovers occur when the bank has low net interest margins.
              Instead, private recapitalizations occur for banks with lower
              equity, higher net interest margins, and positive growth at the

               contractual inefficiencies between suppliers and customers

  abstract  = "ABSTRACT Researchers seldom realize 100\% participation for any
               research study. If participants and non-participants are
               systematically different, substantive results may be biased in
               unknown ways, and external or internal validity may be
               compromised. Typically social work researchers use bivariate
               tests to detect selection bias (e.g., ?2 to compare the race of
               participants and non-participants). Occasionally multiple
               regression methods are used (e.g., logistic regression with
               participation/non-participation as the dependent variable).
               Neither of these methods can be used to correct substantive
               results for selection bias. Sample selection models are a
               well-developed class of econometric models that can be used to
               detect and correct for selection bias, but these are rarely used
               in social work research. Sample selection models can help
               further social work research by providing researchers with
               methods of detecting and correcting sample selection bias.",

              levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to
              1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. It was thus the first
              international treaty to endow the 2 °C global temperature target
              with legal effect. The qualitative expression of the ultimate
              objective in Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention
              on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has now evolved into the numerical
              temperature rise target in Article 2 of the Paris Agreement.
              Starting with the Second Assessment Report (SAR) of the
              Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), an important
              task for subsequent assessments has been to provide scientific
              information to help determine the quantified long-term goal for
              UNFCCC negotiation. However, due to involvement in the value
              judgment within the scope of non-scientific assessment, the IPCC
              has never scientifically affirmed the unacceptable extent of
              global temperature rise. The setting of the long-term goal for

              analyses of climate change in the last decade, namely the Stern
              Report and the IPCC's Fourth Assessment. However, the various
              kinds of uncertainties that affect these economic results raise
              serious questions about whether or not the net costs and benefits
              of mitigating climate change over periods as long as 50 to

              to individual borrower risk levels, has been increasingly used to
              price credit union loans in the United States. The key question
              examined in this research, given credit union not-for-profit
              objectives, is whether this pricing strategy increases the
              availability of loans, particularly for high-risk borrowers. Data
              on the number of loans per credit union member and loan
              delinquency rates are used to assess loan access and average
              risk-levels, respectively. The results indicate that risk-based
              pricing adopters increase the availability of loans relative to
              otherwise similar non-adopters. However, average risk levels, as
              measured by delinquency rates, appear to be somewhat lower for
              adopters of risk-based pricing compared to matched non-adopters.
              This suggests that lending increases primarily for low-risk
              borrowers, which contrasts with claims that risk-based pricing
              chiefly benefits high-risk borrowers who might otherwise be

              financial vulnerability of nonprofit organizations is a
              relatively new area of study. In this paper, we compare two
              models used to forecast bankruptcy in the corporate sector
              (Altman 1968 and Ohlson 1980) with the model used by nonprofit
              researchers (Tuckman and Chang 1991). We find that the Ohlson
              model has higher explanatory power than either Tuckman and
              Chang's or Altman's in predicting four different measures of
              financial vulnerability. However, we show that none of the
              models, individually or combined, are effective in predicting
              financial distress. We then propose a more comprehensive model of
              financial vulnerability by adding two new variables to represent
              reliance on commercial-type activities to generate revenues and
              endowment sufficiency. We find that this model outperforms
              Ohlson's model and performs substantially better in explaining
              and predicting financial vulnerability. Hence, the expanded model
              can be used as a guide for understanding the drivers of financial
              vulnerability and for identifying more effective proxies for
              nonprofit sector financial distress for use in future research.",

               Although not all of the methods and ratios are predictors of
               failure, many ratio variables are found which do predict failure
               of Small Business Administration borrowers and guarantee
               recipients. Using step-wise multiple discriminant analysis with
               a restriction on the simple correlation of the entering variable
               with the included variables, a function of independent ratio
               variables, which is highly accurate in classifying borrowers in
               the test sample, is developed. Methods of analysis found useful
               are (1) classification of a borrower's ratio into quartiles
               relative to other borrowers in the sample, (2) observation of an
               up- or down-trend for a three-year period, (3) combinatorial
               analysis of a ratio's trend and recent level, (A) calculation of
               the three-year average, and (5) division of a ratio by its
               respective RMA industry average ratio. The discriminant function
               demonstrates an ability as great as those functions recently
               estimated for much larger firms. However, the small business
               function fails to discriminate when only one statement is
               available, whereas Altman [1] and Beaver [4, 5] show that one
               financial statement is sufficient for a highly discriminant

               reduce their revenue volatility through diversification,
               particularly by equalizing their reliance on earned income,
               investments, and contributions. This positive effect of
               diversification on revenue stability implies that a diversified
               portfolio encourages more stable revenues and consequently could
               promote greater organizational longevity. Despite any additional
               complexity or crowding out, nonprofit managers may increase the
               financial stability of their organizations by adding additional
               revenue streams. However, our analysis also reveals several
               other important factors that contribute to nonprofit revenue
               stability. In particular, increasing a nonprofit organization's
               total expenses and fund balance reduces volatility, suggesting
               larger nonprofits and organizations with greater growth
               potential experience greater revenue stability. Finally, the
               results suggest nonprofits relying primarily on contributions
               will experience more volatility, whereas nonprofits located

              of the architecture takes advantage of the specific structure of
              limit order books. The new architecture, which we refer to as a
              `spatial neural network', yields a low-dimensional model of price
              movements deep into the limit order book, allowing more effective
              use of information from deep in the limit order book (i.e. many
              levels beyond the best bid and best ask). The spatial neural
              network models the joint distribution of the state of the limit
              order book at a future time conditional on the current state of
              the limit order book. The spatial neural network outperforms
              status quo models such as the naive empirical model, logistic
              regression (with nonlinear features), and a standard neural

              network especially outperforms the standard neural network in the
              tail of the distribution, which is important for risk management

               transactions could be de-anonymised by analysing the Bitcoin
               blockchain and transactions conducted through the blockchain. In
               addition, graph analysis and the use of modern social media
               technology were examined to determine how they may help reveal
               the identity of Bitcoin users. A review of machine learning
               techniques and heuristics was carried out to learn how certain
               behaviours from the Bitcoin network could be augmented with
               social media technology and other data to identify illicit
               transactions. Design/methodology/approach-A number of
               experiments were conducted and time was spend observing the
               network to ascertain how Bitcoin transactions work, how the
               Bitcoin protocol operates over the network and what Bitcoin
               artefacts can be examined from a digital forensics perspective.
               Packet sniffing software, Wireshark, was used to see whether the
               identity of a user is revealed when they set up a wallet via an
               online wallet service. In addition, a block parser was used to
               analyse the Bitcoin client synchronisation and reveal
               information on the behaviour of a Bitcoin node when it joins the
               network and synchronises to the latest blockchain. The final
               experiment involved setting up and witnessing a transaction
               using the Bitcoin Client API. These experiments and observations
               were then used to design a proof of concept and functional
               software architecture for searching, indexing and analyzing
               publicly available data flowing from the blockchain and other
               big data sources. Findings-Using heuristics and graph analysis
               techniques show us that it is possible to build up a picture of
               behaviour of Bitcoin addresses and transactions, then utilise
               existing typologies of illicit behaviour to collect, process and
               exploit potential red flag indicators. Augmenting Bitcoin data,

              of markets: the New York and American Stock Exchanges, the
              Australian, English, and German stock markets, various commodity
              futures markets, the Over-the-Counter markets, the corporate and
              government bond markets, the option market, and the market for
              seats on the New York Stock Exchange. Yet, in a manner remarkably
              similar to that described by Thomas Kuhn in his book, The
              Structure of Scientific Revolutions, we seem to be entering a
              stage where widely scattered and as yet incohesive evidence is
              arising which seems to be inconsistent with the theory. As better
              data become available (e.g., daily stock price data) and as our
              econometric sophistication increases, we are beginning to find
              inconsistencies that our cruder data and techniques missed in the
              past. It is evidence which we will not be able to ignore. The
              purpose of this special issue of the Journal of Financial
              Economics is to bring together a number of these scattered pieces
              of anomalous evidence regarding Market Efficiency. As Ball (1978)
              points out in his survey article: taken individually many
              scattered pieces of evidence on the reaction of stock prices to
              earnings announcements which are inconsistent with the theory
              don't amount to much. Yet viewed as a whole, these pieces of
              evidence begin to stack up in a manner which make a much stronger
              case for the necessity to carefully review both our acceptance of

  abstract  = "Anomalies are empirical results that seem to be inconsistent
               with maintained theories of asset-pricing behavior. They
               indicate either market inefficiency (profit opportunities) or
               inadequacies in the underlying asset-pricing model. After they
               are documented and analyzed in the academic literature,
               anomalies often seem to disappear, reverse, or attenuate. This
               raises the question of whether profit opportunities existed in
               the past, but have since been arbitraged away, or whether the
               anomalies were simply statistical aberrations that attracted the
               attention of academics and practitioners. One of the interesting
               findings from the empirical work in this chapter is that many of
               the well-known anomalies in the finance literature do not hold
               up in different sample periods. In particular, the size effect
               and the value effect seem to have disappeared after the papers
               that highlighted them were published. At about the same time,
               practitioners began investment vehicles that implemented the
               strategies implied by the academic papers. The weekend effect
               and the dividend yield effect also seem to have lost their
               predictive power after the papers that made them famous were
               published. In these cases, however, I am not aware of any
               practitioners who have tried to use these anomalies as a major
               basis of their investment strategy. The small-firm
               turn-of-the-year effect became weaker in the years after it was
               first documented in the academic literature, although there is
               some evidence that it still exists. Interestingly, however, it
               does not seem to exist in the portfolio returns of practitioners
               who focus on small-capitalization firms. Likewise, the evidence
               that stock market returns are predictable using variables such
               as dividend yields or inflation is much weaker in the periods
               after the papers that documented these findings were published.
               All of these findings raise the possibility that anomalies are
               more apparent than real. The notoriety associated with the
               findings of unusual evidence tempts authors to further
               investigate puzzling anomalies and later to try to explain them.
               But even if the anomalies existed in the sample period in which
               they were first identified, the activities of practitioners who
               implement strategies to take advantage of anomalous behavior can
               cause the anomalies to disappear (as research findings cause the
               market to become more efficient).",

               crisis, and new paths to global prosperity After the global
               financial crisis, responsible financial innovation is more
               crucial than ever. However, financial innovation will only
               succeed if it reflects the true lessons of the past decade. In
               this collection, three leading global finance researchers share
               those lessons, offering crucial insights for market
               participants, policymakers, and other stakeholders. Drawing on
               their pioneering work, they illuminate new opportunities for
               sustainable innovation in finance that can help restore housing
               markets and the overall global economy, while avoiding the
               failures of predecessors. In Financing the Future, Franklin
               Allen and Glenn Yago carefully discuss the current role of
               financial innovation in capitalizing businesses, industries,
               breakthrough technologies, housing solutions, medical
               treatments, and environmental projects. Allen and Yago explain
               how sophisticated capital structures can enable companies and
               individuals to raise funding in larger amounts for longer terms
               at lower cost, accomplishing tasks that would otherwise be
               impossible -- and offer a full chapter of essential lessons for
               using financial innovation to add value, manage risk, and
               improve the stability of the global economy. Next, in Fixing the
               Housing Market, Allen, Yago, and James R. Barth explain how
               responsible financial innovation can ``reboot'' damaged housing
               markets, improve their efficiency, and make housing more
               accessible to millions. The authors walk through the history of
               housing finance, evaluate housing finance systems in mature
               economies during and after the crisis, highlight benefits and
               risks associated with each leading mortgage funding structure
               and product, and assess current housing finance structures in
               BRIC economies. Building on these comparisons, they show how to
               create a more stable and sustainable financing system for
               housing: one that provides better shelter for more people, helps
               the industry recover, and creates thousands of new jobs. From

               finance that still holds credit risk as its main risk. According
               to the internal rating method of the New Basel Accord, in
               addition to the probability of default, loss given default is
               also one of the important indicators of evaluation credit risks.
               Proceeding from the perspective of loss given default (LGD),
               this paper conducts an empirical study on the probability
               distribution of LGDs of P2P as well as its influencing factors
               with the transaction data of Lending Club. The results show
               that: (1) the LGDs of P2P loans presents an obvious unimodal
               distribution, the peak value is relatively high and tends to
               concentrate with the decrease of the borrower's credit rating,
               indicating that the distribution of LGDs of P2P lending is
               similar to that of unsecured bonds; (2) The total asset of the
               borrower has no significant impact on LGD, the credit rating and
               the debt-to-income ratio exert a significant negative impact,
               while the term and amount of the loan produce a relatively
               strong positive impact. Therefore, when evaluating the

               successful tool to predict financial time series. The core idea
               of this study is to outline an automated framework for achieving
               a faster and easier parameter selection process, and at the same
               time, generating useful prediction uncertainty estimates in
               order to effectively tackle flexible real-world financial time
               series prediction problems. A Bayesian approach to SVR is
               discussed, and implemented. It is found that the direct
               implementation of the probabilistic framework of Gao et al.
               returns unsatisfactory results in our experiments. A novel
               enhancement is proposed by adding a new kernel scaling parameter
               $\mu$ to overcome the difficulties encountered. In addition, the
               multi-armed bandit Bayesian optimization technique is applied to
               automate the parameter selection process. Our framework is then
               tested on financial time series of various asset classes (i.e.
               equity index, credit default swaps spread, bond yields, and
               commodity futures) to ensure its flexibility. It is shown that
               the generalization performance of this parameter selection
               process can reach or sometimes surpass the computationally
               expensive cross-validation procedure. An adaptive calibration
               process is also described to allow practical use of the
               prediction uncertainty estimates to assess the quality of
               predictions. It is shown that the machine-learning approach
               discussed in this study can be developed as a very useful
               pricing tool, and potentially a market condition change
               detector. A further extension is possible by taking the
               prediction uncertainties into consideration when building a

               words used by online investors when they share opinions and

               methods used in the literature while remaining competitive with
               more complex machine learning algorithms. Aggregating individual

               evidence that online investor sentiment helps forecast intraday

               we find that the first half-hour change in investor sentiment

              Factorization Machines, for which efficient training algorithms
              have only been available since 2016. As Factorization Machines

              speed-ups of several orders of magnitude by deploying machine
              learning techniques based on Gaussian process regression. The
              price we have to pay for this extra speed is some loss of
              accuracy. However, we show that this reduced accuracy is often
              well within reasonable limits and hence very acceptable from a
              practical point of view. The concrete examples concern fitting
              and estimation. In the fitting context, we fit sophisticated
              Greek profiles and summarize implied volatility surfaces. In the
              estimation context, we reduce computation times for the
              calculation of vanilla option values under advanced models, the
              pricing of American options and the pricing of exotic options
              under models beyond the Black--Scholes setting. \copyright{}

  abstract  = "Today's financial regulatory systems assume that regulations
               which make individual banks safe also make the financial system
               safe. The eleventh Geneva Report on the World Economy shows that
               this thinking is flawed. Actions that banks take to make
               themselves safer can - in times of crisis - undermine the
               system's stability. The Report argues for a different approach.
               What is needed is micro-prudential (i.e. bank-level) regulation,
               macro-prudential (i.e. system-wide) regulation, and careful
               coordination of the two. Macro-prudential regulation in
               particular needs reform to ensure it countervails the natural
               decline in measured risk during booms and its rise in subsequent
               collapses. ``Counter-cyclical capital charges'' are the way
               forward; regulators should adjust capital adequacy requirements
               over the cycle by two multiples - the first related to
               above-average growth of credit expansion and leverage, the
               second related to the mismatch in the maturity of assets and
               liabilities. Changes to mark-to-market procedures are also
               needed. Macro- and micro-prudential regulation should be carried
               out by separate institutions since they differ in focus and
               expertise required. Central Banks should be tasked with
               macro-prudential regulation, Financial Services Authorities with
               micro-prudential regulation. Improved international coordination
               is also important. Since financial and asset-price cycles differ
               from country to country, counter-cyclical regulatory policy
               needs to be implemented mainly by the ``host'' rather than the
               ``home'' country.",

  abstract  = "In the wake of the worst financial crisis in 2008, most US banks
               were bailed out while Canadian banks sailed through the crisis
               relatively unscathed. This has compelled some analysts to
               question why banking crises happen in America but not in Canada.
               We examine the risk-taking behavior of banks in the US and
               Canada prior to the recent financial crisis and find that
               Canadian banks had lower risk than their US counterparts over
               the study period. Further analysis shows that entry
               restrictions, which create concentrated banking structure,
               strong supervisory power, and discipline constrain excessive
               risk taking by Canadian banks. Entry restrictions enable
               Canadian banks to generate higher profits and lower variability
               of asset returns, while restrictions on activities reduce
               profitability and increase variability in asset return. However,
               the former seems to overwhelm the effect of asset restrictions,
               given the lower risk that we observe for the Canadian banks. The
               less concentrated but competitive banking structure in the US is
               associated with higher bank risk taking. \copyright{} 2017

               theory, empirical analysis, and practitioner, and policy-related
               material. The Handbook is split into five parts. Part I, The
               Theory of Banking, examines the role of banks in the wider
               financial system, why banks exist, how they function, and their
               corporate governance and risk management practices. Part II
               deals with Bank Operations and Performance. A range of issues
               are covered including bank performance, financial innovation,
               and technological change. Aspects relating to small business,
               consumer, and mortgage lending are analysed together with
               securitization, shadow banking, and payment systems. Part III
               entitled Regulatory and Policy Perspectives discusses central
               banking, monetary policy transmission, market discipline, and
               prudential regulation and supervision. Part IV of the book
               covers various Macroeconomic Perspectives in Banking. This part
               includes a discussion of systemic risk and banking and sovereign
               crises, the role of the state in finance and development as well
               as how banks influence real economic activity. The final Part V

               studies examining the predictability of the direction/sign of
               stock index movement. Given the notion that a prediction with
               little forecast error does not necessarily translate into
               capital gain, we evaluate the efficacy of several multivariate
               classification techniques relative to a group of level
               estimation approaches. Specifically, we conduct time series
               comparisons between the two types of models on the basis of
               forecast performance and investment return. The tested
               classification models, which predict direction based on
               probability, include linear discriminant analysis, logit,
               probit, and probabilistic neural network. On the other hand, the
               level estimation counterparts, which forecast the level, are
               exponential smoothing, multivariate transfer function, vector
               autoregression with Kalman filter, and multilayered feedforward
               neural network. Our comparative study also measures the relative
               strength of these models with respect to the trading profit

               trading, we develop a set of threshold trading rules driven by
               the probabilities estimated by the classification models.
               Empirical experimentation suggests that the classification

               predicting the direction of the stock market movement and

              relationships of bank business models to the two dimensions of
              systemic risk. The observed differences in these relationships

              whenever capital gains and the news event have the same sign. The

              experienced by the stock holders on the event date. An

               question rely solely on the views of investors who already
               invest in SRI funds. Our study surveys a unique pool of
               approximately 5,000 investors that contains both investors who
               have used SRI criteria in investment decisions and those who
               have not, and involves a broad array of criteria associated with
               SR investing. Our findings offer new insight into the SRI
               debate. For both sets of investors, environmental and
               sustainability issues dominate as the major category associated

               positive social behavior rather than to exclude firms on the
               basis of certain products or practices. These findings can help

               managed assets. Its conceptual origins can be found in the early

              control for overparametrization, we rely on the Bayesian

              unstable regime at the beginning of the previous decade. My
              results indicate that these imbalances could have been detected
              with the aid of real-time econometric modeling. With reference to
              Stiglitz's general conception of a bubble, I use the econometric
              results to construct two bubble indicators, which clearly
              demonstrate the transition to an unstable regime in the early
              2000s. The indicators are shown to Granger cause a set of
              coincident indicators and financial (in)stability measures.

              concentrating on individual firms' conduct and by studying a much

               professional football (soccer). More specifically, Weber's

               the widespread assumption within football that previous playing
               experience is sufficient preparation for entry into management.
               While many aspects of the management of football clubs have

               the role of the manager has proved remarkably resistant to these

               managers an unusually high degree of autonomy in defining their

               normative theory. Normative theories suggest particular
               heuristics, or cognitive representations, to find appropriate
               solutions. Heuristics permit faster solutions to real-time
               problems; they also suffer from the potential of negative
               transfer to inappropriate applications. The theory of real
               options provides the appropriate heuristic framing of
               competencies and exploratory search. A real options approach
               marries the theory of financial options to foundational ideas in
               strategy, organizational theory, and complex systems. We join
               these approaches to identify three pairs of concepts: scarce
               factor and the underlying asset in option theory, inertia and
               irreversibility, and the ruggedness of landscape and option
               values. Strategic theories of resources largely define a core
               competence as unique and nonimmutable. In doing so, this
               definition has wrongly forgotten Barney's initial insight into
               scarce factor markets as determining the valuation of a
               competitive asset. Financial theory of real options derives its
               heuristics of investing in exploratory search by inferring
               future value of today's investments from market prices. We apply
               the three conceptual pairs to the evaluation of capabilities as
               real options through a formal descriptive model. The valuation
               of core capabilities is derived from observing the price
               dynamics of correlated strategic factors in the market. Because
               of inertia, managers cannot easily adjust the wrong set of
               organizational capabilities to the emergence of market
               opportunities. However, firms that have made investments in
               capabilities appropriate to these opportunities are able to
               respond. From this description, we define core competence as the
               choice of capabilities that permits the firm to make the best
               response to market opportunities. The heuristic framing of
               capabilities as real options guides the normative evaluation of
               the balance between exploitation and exploration.",

               and we show how it can uniquely address the fundamental issues

               Real options theory (ROT) applies the heuristics and valuation
               models originally designed for financial securities to the
               domain of corporate investment decisions (e.g., joint ventures

               [R\&D], etc.) and strategic decision making under uncertainty.
               This article provides a synthesis of this body of research in
               strategic management and related disciplines. We suggest how ROT
               can address fundamental issues of strategy, including the
               dilemmas managers face between commitment versus flexibility as
               well as between competition versus cooperation. We discuss how

               complement each other, and we identify some of the main

               to environment for all US publicly traded companies from 1980 to
               2009. In keeping with the view that environmental corporate
               social responsibility (CSR) generates new and competitive
               resources for firms, I find that companies reported to behave

               ?environment-as-a-resource,? I posit that the value of
               environmental CSR depends on external and internal moderators.

               recent decades?exacerbates the punishment for eco-harmful
               behavior and reduces the reward for eco-friendly initiatives.
               This argument is supported by the data: over time, the negative
               stock market reaction to eco-harmful behavior has increased,
               while the positive reaction to eco-friendly initiatives has
               decreased. Second, I argue that environmental CSR is a resource
               with decreasing marginal returns and insurance-like features. In
               keeping with this view, I find that the positive (negative)
               stock market reaction to eco-friendly (-harmful) events is

               paper of credit unions and banks in the US which found that
               credit unions in Wisconsin, Arizona and New Hampshire were more
               likely to be located in lower-income areas than bank branches
               (Mook, Maiorano \& Quarter, 2015). In Canada, we find that

               under-represented in large population centres relative to bank

               marginalized communities they cater to distinguishes them.
               Making use of the Canadian Marginalization Index, we find credit

               application of a maturity model to 15 credit unions in North

               early stage of development, but there are signs of future
               improvement. Credit unions operate in a highly competitive,
               knowledge-intensive financial industry and experience various
               pressures to increase their efficiency, which they can achieve
               through the implementation of KM solutions. Despite the absence
               of official KM strategies, KM projects were introduced locally
               in order to fill particular knowledge gaps. The availability of
               IT infrastructure and the implementation of KM-related
               technologies alone are insufficient to ensure universal success

              distress and they also have an incentive to increase risk to
              exploit the cost-of-funds subsidy of mispriced deposit insurance.
              These are contrasting incentives tied to bank size. Measuring the
              performance of banks and its relationship to size requires
              untangling cost and profit from decisions about risk versus

               stability and foster competitive balance, they focus on a

               constraints on the joint sporting and financial efficiency of
               English football clubs.Research methods: The simultaneous
               production of both sporting and financial outputs are modelled
               using stochastic, non-parametric efficiency analysis. The sample

               Financial Fair Play breakeven regulation reduces average club

               (capturing revenue share) whilst lowering the relative

              that breaks can lead to a negative slope in the relationship

              linear asset pricing models, while limiting the occurrence of
              false positive results typically associated with data-snooping.
              We first develop alpha test statistics that are asymptotically
              valid, weakly dependent in the cross-section, and robust to the
              possibility of omitted factors. We then combine them in a

              discoveries is ex-ante bounded below a pre-specified 5\% level.
              We also show that this method can detect all positive alphas with
              reasonable strengths. Our procedure is designed for
              high-dimensional settings and works even when the number of tests

              with a new estimator called the three-pass regression filter
              (3PRF). It is calculated in closed form and conveniently
              represented as a set of ordinary least squares regressions. 3PRF
              forecasts are consistent for the infeasible best forecast when
              both the time dimension and cross section dimension become large.
              This requires specifying only the number of relevant factors
              driving the forecast target, regardless of the total number of
              common factors driving the cross section of predictors. The 3PRF
              is a constrained least squares estimator and reduces to partial
              least squares as a special case. Simulation evidence confirms the
              3PRF's forecasting performance relative to alternatives. We

              Our crucial innovation is the use of the no-arbitrage condition

              stochastic discount factor (SDF or pricing kernel) that explains
              all asset prices from the conditional moment constraints implied
              by no-arbitrage. For this purpose, we combine three different
              deep neural network structures in a novel way: A feedforward
              network to capture non-linearities, a recurrent
              Long-Short-Term-Memory network to find a small set of economic

              system for emissions from energy-intensive installations (ETS

               prioritization of actions and their effectiveness. So far,
               analysis of interactions has been very basic, typically starting
               from one SDG, counting the number of interactions, and
               discussing synergies and trade-offs from the perspective of that
               issue area. This paper pushes the frontier of how interactions
               amongst SDG targets can be understood and taken into account in
               policy and planning. It presents an approach to assessing
               systemic and contextual interactions of SDG targets, using a
               typology for scoring interactions in a cross-impact matrix and
               using network analysis techniques to explore the data. By
               considering how a target interacts with another target and how
               that target in turn interacts with other targets, results
               provide a more robust basis for priority setting of SDG efforts.
               The analysis identifies which targets have the most and least
               positive influence on the network and thus guides, where efforts
               may be directed (and not); where strong positive and negative

                   2014. Our estimators of term structures of conditional
                   probabilities of prepayment, foreclosure and various states
                   of delinquency incorporate the dynamics of a large number of
                   loan-specific as well as macroeconomic variables down to the
                   zip-code level. The estimators uncover the highly nonlinear
                   nature of the relationship between the variables and
                   borrower behavior, especially prepayment. They also
                   highlight the effects of local economic conditions on
                   borrower behavior. State unemployment has the greatest
                   explanatory power among all variables, offering strong
                   evidence of the tight connection between housing finance
                   markets and the macroeconomy. The sensitivity of a borrower
                   to changes in unemployment strongly depends upon current
                   unemployment. It also significantly varies across the entire
                   borrower population, which highlights the interaction of
                   unemployment and many other variables. These findings have
                   important implications for mortgage-backed security
                   investors, rating agencies, and housing finance

              analysis and logistic regression, in building credit scoring
              models in the credit union environment. Also, since funding and
              small sample size often preclude the use of customized credit
              scoring models at small credit unions, we investigate the
              performance of generic models and compare them with customized
              models. Our results indicate that customized neural networks
              offer a very promising avenue if the measure of performance is

              measure of performance is percentage of good and bad loans
              correctly classified, logistic regression models are comparable
              to the neural networks approach. The performance of generic
              models was not as good as the customized models, particularly
              when it came to correctly classifying bad loans. Although we
              found significant differences in the results for the three credit

               machines to life--driving cars, trading stocks, and teaching
               children. But facing the sea change that AI will bring can be
               paralyzing. How should companies set strategies, governments
               design policies, and people plan their lives for a world so
               different from what we know? In the face of such uncertainty,
               many analysts either cower in fear or predict an impossibly
               sunny future.But in Prediction Machines, three eminent
               economists recast the rise of AI as a drop in the cost of
               prediction. With this single, masterful stroke, they lift the
               curtain on the AI-is-magic hype and show how basic tools from
               economics provide clarity about the AI revolution and a basis
               for action by CEOs, managers, policy makers, investors, and
               entrepreneurs.When AI is framed as cheap prediction, its
               extraordinary potential becomes clear:Prediction is at the heart
               of making decisions under uncertainty. Our businesses and
               personal lives are riddled with such decisions.Prediction tools
               increase productivity--operating machines, handling documents,
               communicating with customers.Uncertainty constrains strategy.
               Better prediction creates opportunities for new business
               structures and strategies to compete.Penetrating, fun, and
               always insightful and practical, Prediction Machines follows its
               inescapable logic to explain how to navigate the changes on the

               tests and several state-of-the-art volatility models to assess
               the effect of news on the returns, price jumps and the

               sentiment and the dynamic characteristics of natural gas futures
               prices. Our findings are, among others, that the arrival of news
               in non-trading periods causes overnight returns, that news
               sentiment is Granger caused by negative semi-volatility and that
               news sentiment is more sensitive to negative than to positive

  abstract = "The behaviour of time series data from financial markets is
              influenced by a rich mixture of quantitative information from the
              dynamics of the system, captured in its past behaviour, and
              qualitative information about the underlying fundamentals
              arriving via various forms of news feeds. Pattern recognition of
              financial data using an effective combination of these two types
              of information is of much interest nowadays, and is addressed in
              several academic disciplines as well as by practitioners. Recent
              literature has focused much effort on the use of news-derived
              information to predict the direction of movement of a stock, i.e.
              posed as a classification problem, or the precise value of a
              future asset price, i.e. posed as a regression problem. Here, we
              show that information extracted from news sources is better at
              predicting the direction of underlying asset volatility movement,
              or its second order statistics, rather than its direction of
              price movement. We show empirical results by constructing machine
              learning models of Latent Dirichlet Allocation to represent
              information from news feeds, and simple na{\"\i}ve Bayes
              classifiers to predict the direction of movements. Empirical
              results show that the average directional prediction accuracy for
              volatility, on arrival of new information, is 56\%, while that of
              the asset close price is no better than random at 49\%. We
              evaluate these results using a range of stocks and stock indices
              in the US market, using a reliable news source as input. We
              conclude that volatility movements are more predictable than
              asset price movements when using financial news as machine
              learning input, and hence could potentially be exploited in

               following factor investing strategies based on equity asset
               pricing anomalies, such as the small-cap, value, and momentum
               effects, earn significantly higher alphas than traditional
               actively managed mutual funds. The authors report that a
               buy-and-hold strategy for a random factor fund yields 110 basis
               points per annum in excess of the return earned by the average
               traditional actively managed mutual fund. However, they find
               that the actual returns that investors earn by investing in
               factor mutual funds are significantly lower because investors
               dynamically reallocate their funds both across factors and
               factor managers. Although factor funds have attracted
               significant fund flows over their sample period, it appears that
               fund flows have been driven by factor funds earning high past
               returns and not by the funds providing factor exposures. The
               authors argue that, rather than timing factors and factor
               managers, investors would be better off by using a buy-and-hold

               non-systemic banks (non-GSIBs) is driven by policy reasons. This
               study aims to examine the behaviour of non-performing loans in
               European GSIBs and non-GSIBs from 2004 to
               2013.Design/methodology/approach The author uses regression
               methodology to analyse the association between non-performing
               loans (NPLs) and the state of the economy.Findings The author
               finds that more profitable banks witness higher NPLs regardless
               of them being systemic or non-systemic. Secondly, GSIBs have
               fewer NPLs during economic booms and during periods of increased
               lending, while non-GSIBs experience higher NPLs during periods
               of increased lending. The author also observes that European
               non-GSIBs that exceed regulatory capital requirement also
               experience higher NPLs. In the post-crisis period, there is a
               significant and negative relationship between NPLs and the
               economic cycle for GSIBs in the post-financial crisis period and
               a significant and positive relationship between NPLs, loan
               supply and bank profitability for GSIBs in the post-financial
               crisis period; on the other hand, there is a significant and
               negative relationship between NPLs and regulatory capital ratios
               for non-GSIBs in the post-financial crisis period and a
               significant and positive relationship between NPLs and bank
               profitability for non-GSIBs in the post-financial crisis period.
               The findings have implications.Originality/value To the best of
               the author's knowledge, the literature on the determinants of
               NPL has not empirically examined the behaviour of NPLs in
               European GSIBs and non-GSIBs. This paper examines this issue to

               quality of credit exposure determinants of banks in European
               Union countries that were characterized by a high level of
               impaired loans at the end of 2017 (Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus,
               Italy, Ireland, Greece, Portugal). Using the static panel-based
               approach the non-performing loan (NPL) determinants for the
               period from 2011 to 2017 were analyzed. The results showed that
               the high level of NPLs can be explained mainly by both
               macroeconomic and microeconomic factors. In particular, it has
               been shown that in the surveyed countries supervisory
               authorities should pay special attention to smaller banks with
               high dynamics of new loans and a low return on assets due to the
               fact that these entities are characterized by a higher NPL
               ratio. A higher level of NPL is also affected by a high
               concentration of the banking sector and higher interest rates on
               newly granted loans. As a result of research it was also shown
               that the majority of NPL determinants are the same in all types
               of banks, regardless of the business model and the scope of
               banking supervision. The differences were noticeable in

              Since asset returns have substantial commonality, absence of

              factor can be represented as a function of a few dominant sources

  abstract = "It is well known that a jostled string tends to become knotted;
              yet the factors governing the ``spontaneous'' formation of
              various knots are unclear. We performed experiments in which a
              string was tumbled inside a box and found that complex knots
              often form within seconds. We used mathematical knot theory to
              analyze the knots. Above a critical string length, the
              probability P of knotting at first increased sharply with length
              but then saturated below 100\%. This behavior differs from that
              of mathematical self-avoiding random walks, where P has been
              proven to approach 100\%. Finite agitation time and jamming of
              the string due to its stiffness result in lower probability, but
              P approaches 100\% with long, flexible strings. We analyzed the
              knots by calculating their Jones polynomials via computer
              analysis of digital photos of the string. Remarkably, almost all
              were identified as prime knots: 120 different types, having
              minimum crossing numbers up to 11, were observed in 3,415 trials.
              All prime knots with up to seven crossings were observed. The
              relative probability of forming a knot decreased exponentially
              with minimum crossing number and M{\"o}bius energy, mathematical
              measures of knot complexity. Based on the observation that long,
              stiff strings tend to form a coiled structure when confined, we
              propose a simple model to describe the knot formation based on
              random ``braid moves'' of the string end. Our model can
              qualitatively account for the observed distribution of knots and
              dependence on agitation time and string length.",

               analogous way to randomization in a clinical trial, to estimate
               the causal relationship between a phenotype and an outcome
               variable. Our purpose is to extend the existing methods for such
               Mendelian randomization studies to the context of multiple
               genetic markers measured in multiple studies, based on the
               analysis of individual participant data. First, for a single
               genetic marker in one study, we show that the usual ratio of
               coefficients approach can be reformulated as a regression with
               heterogeneous error in the explanatory variable. This can be
               implemented using a Bayesian approach, which is next extended to
               include multiple genetic markers. We then propose a hierarchical
               model for undertaking a meta-analysis of multiple studies, in
               which it is not necessary that the same genetic markers are
               measured in each study. This provides an overall estimate of the
               causal relationship between the phenotype and the outcome, and
               an assessment of its heterogeneity across studies. As an
               example, we estimate the causal relationship of blood
               concentrations of C-reactive protein on fibrinogen levels using
               data from 11 studies. These methods provide a flexible framework
               for efficient estimation of causal relationships derived from
               multiple studies. Issues discussed include weak instrument bias,

              capital requirement (MCR) in three prominent versions of the
              Basel regulatory framework: Basel II, the 2010 version of Basel
              III and the current 2013 version of Basel III. For this purpose,
              we use Cantelli's inequality to compute theoretical MCR violation
              levels for different unconditional distributional specifications,
              accounting for skewness and kurtosis. Cantelli's inequality
              allows us to perform a quantitative comparison of various Basel
              accords without exact knowledge of the future return process.
              Therefore, our results are not biased, due to the specific choice
              of the sample data and/or uncertainty about the underlying return
              process as well as the ``true'' risk model. We find that under
              weak distributional specifications (ie, normal tails), the MCR
              under the 2013 version of Basel III is only marginally higher
              than under Basel II. However, this difference increases
              (decreases) for risk models equipped with heavy-tailed (normal)
              innovations. In contrast to this, we document that under the 2010
              version of Basel III the MCR violation levels during a stress
              period are adequate, even when using a risk model with weak
              distributional specifications. However, we also show that the MCR
              under the 2010 version of Basel III is too conservative in calm

              expected shortfall (MES) of Brownlees and Engle (Volatility,
              correlation and tails for systemic risk measurement, Social

              conditional Value-at-Risk (CoVaR) of Adrian and Brunnermeier
              (2011). We use a primary database of Taiwan financial
              institutions for our empirical study. A panel contains data of
              stock market returns and balance sheets of 31 Taiwan financial
              institutions for 2005--2014. We focus on systemic risk analysis
              so as to understand the dynamics of volatility, interdependency,
              and risk during the recent financial crisis. We then report the
              time series dynamics and cross sectional rankings of these

              these three measures differ in their definition of the

              identifying systemically important financial institutions

              contributions are closely related to certain institution

               financial risk. Expectiles offset the weaknesses of
               value-at-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall. Indeed, expectiles

               robustness, this article more closely examines regulatory
               applications of expectiles. Expectiles are most readily

               regulatory implementation, expectiles can be defined exclusively
               in terms of VaR, expected shortfall, and the thresholds at which
               those competing risk measures are enforced. Moreover, expectiles

  author   = "Constantinou, Anthony C",
  abstract = "The paper describes Dolores, a model designed to predict football
              match outcomes in one country by observing football matches in
              multiple other countries. The model is a mixture of two methods:
              (a) dynamic ratings and (b) Hybrid Bayesian Networks. It was
              developed as part of the international special issue competition
              Machine Learning for Soccer. Unlike past academic literature
              which tends to focus on a single league or tournament, Dolores is
              trained with a single dataset that incorporates match outcomes,
              with missing data (as part of the challenge), from 52 football
              leagues from all over the world. The challenge involved using a
              single model to predict 206 future match outcomes from 26
              different leagues, played from March 31 to April 9 in 2017.
              Dolores ranked 2nd in the competition with a predictive error
              0.94\% higher than the top and 116.78\% lower than the bottom
              participants. The paper extends the assessment of the model in
              terms of profitability against published market odds. Given that
              the training dataset incorporates a number of challenges as part
              of the competition, the results suggest that the model
              generalised well over multiple leagues, divisions, and seasons.
              Furthermore, while detailed historical performance for each team
              helps to maximise predictive accuracy, Dolores provides empirical
              proof that a model can make a good prediction for a match outcome
              between teams x and y even when the prediction is derived from
              historical match data that neither x nor y participated in. While
              this agrees with past studies in football and other sports, this
              paper extends the empirical evidence to historical training data
              that does not just include match results from a single
              competition but contains results spanning different leagues and
              divisions from 35 different countries. This implies that we can
              still predict, for example, the outcome of English Premier League
              matches, based on training data from Japan, New Zealand, Mexico,
              South Africa, Russia, and other countries in addition to data
              from the English Premier league.",

              as a potential greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation option for fossil
              fuel power plants. Cost and performance estimates for CCS are
              critical factors in energy and policy analysis. CCS cost studies
              necessarily employ a host of technical and economic assumptions
              that can dramatically affect results. Thus, particular studies
              often are of limited value to analysts, researchers, and industry
              personnel seeking results for alternative cases. In this paper,
              we use a generalized modeling tool to estimate and compare the
              emissions, efficiency, resource requirements and current costs of
              fossil fuel power plants with CCS on a systematic basis. This
              plant-level analysis explores a broader range of key assumptions
              than found in recent studies we reviewed for three major plant
              types: pulverized coal (PC) plants, natural gas combined cycle
              (NGCC) plants, and integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC)
              systems using coal. In particular, we examine the effects of
              recent increases in capital costs and natural gas prices, as well
              as effects of differential plant utilization rates, IGCC
              financing and operating assumptions, variations in plant size,
              and differences in fuel quality, including bituminous,
              sub-bituminous and lignite coals. Our results show higher power
              plant and CCS costs than prior studies as a consequence of recent
              escalations in capital and operating costs. The broader range of
              cases also reveals differences not previously reported in the
              relative costs of PC, NGCC and IGCC plants with and without CCS.
              While CCS can significantly reduce power plant emissions of CO2
              (typically by 85--90\%), the impacts of CCS energy requirements
              on plant-level resource requirements and multi-media
              environmental emissions also are found to be significant, with
              increases of approximately 15--30\% for current CCS systems. To
              characterize such impacts, an alternative definition of the
              ``energy penalty'' is proposed in lieu of the prevailing use of
              this term.",

                 capitalization of banks, market discipline, and supervisory
                 power since the global financial crisis. It shows that
                 regulatory capital increased, but some elements of capital
                 regulations became laxer. Market discipline may have

               favorably to messages focusing on the desirability of the
               offering, when they are further distanced from the actual
               purchase decision. On the other hand, the authors expect more
               favorable responses toward messages containing feasibility
               appeals, positioned closer by to the purchase decision. The
               purpose of this paper is to determine appropriate location-based
               content for in-store proximity
               marketing.Design/methodology/approach A field experiment was
               conducted in a Belgian coffee bar, examining temporal distance
               effects in a natural retail/service environment. A 2$\times$2
               between-subjects experimental design is implemented (i.e. low vs
               high temporal distance$\times$concrete/cost vs
               abstract/brand-oriented appeal), examining the impact on
               marketing communication effectiveness.Findings Overall, the
               authors find some initial support for CLT on effectiveness
               measures regarding purchase intentions and actual purchase, but
               not in terms of self-reported noticing of the screen and the ad,
               nor in terms of (un)aided ad recall.Research
               limitations/implications This experiment is a pilot study and
               such finds itself confronted with a limited number of
               observations.Originality/value The study is among the first to
               examine how message content (beyond price promotion) can be
               adapted to in-store locations.",

               Wall Street and the other a leading scholar in behavioral
               finance?debate the current validity of the efficient markets
               hypothesis (EMH). For over 30 years, the idea that capital
               markets are efficient and that stock prices reflect all publicly
               available information dominated academic thinking. But the
               bubble of the late 1990s and recent advances in behavioral
               finance have forced a re-thinking. Behavioralists argue that
               markets are at least ?weakly? predictable. They also point to
               evidence that small investors ?typically day
               traders?consistently lose money as a result of ?loss
               aversion,??overconfidence,? and other behaviors that are not
               part of the focus of EMH (though, as Malkiel notes, there is
               room for irrational investors in an EMH world provided there are
               enough rational investors to counteract and correct them).
               Proponents of EMH, of course, argue that neither individual
               investors nor active fund managers reliably outperform markets,
               so there is no point paying for active management. Yet these
               seemingly disparate views lead to important areas of common
               ground. In particular, both camps agree that individual
               investors should stick to broad-based, low-cost index funds. And
               retirement accounts?either 401Ks or social security
               accounts?should have limited investment selections in order to

               amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine,
               biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding
               these data has led to the development of new tools in the field
               of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining,
               machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have
               common underpinnings but are often expressed with different
               terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these
               areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is
               statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than
               mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of
               color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and
               anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The
               book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction)
               to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural
               networks, support vector machines, classification trees and
               boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in
               any book. This major new edition features many topics not
               covered in the original, including graphical models, random
               forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression \& path
               algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and
               spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for
               ``wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and
               false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and

  abstract  = "A comprehensive introduction to machine learning that uses
               probabilistic models and inference as a unifying
               approach.Today's Web-enabled deluge of electronic data calls for
               automated methods of data analysis. Machine learning provides
               these, developing methods that can automatically detect patterns
               in data and then use the uncovered patterns to predict future
               data. This textbook offers a comprehensive and self-contained
               introduction to the field of machine learning, based on a
               unified, probabilistic approach.The coverage combines breadth
               and depth, offering necessary background material on such topics
               as probability, optimization, and linear algebra as well as
               discussion of recent developments in the field, including
               conditional random fields, L1 regularization, and deep learning.
               The book is written in an informal, accessible style, complete
               with pseudo-code for the most important algorithms. All topics
               are copiously illustrated with color images and worked examples
               drawn from such application domains as biology, text processing,
               computer vision, and robotics. Rather than providing a cookbook
               of different heuristic methods, the book stresses a principled
               model-based approach, often using the language of graphical
               models to specify models in a concise and intuitive way. Almost
               all the models described have been implemented in a MATLAB
               software package---PMTK (probabilistic modeling toolkit)---that
               is freely available online. The book is suitable for upper-level
               undergraduates with an introductory-level college math
               background and beginning graduate students.",

              literature on the cross-section of stock returns for a carefully
              constructed dataset of euro area stocks. First, we confirm recent
              results for US data and find evidence of a negative
              cross-sectional relation between extreme positive returns and
              average returns after controlling for characteristics such as
              momentum, book-to-market, size, liquidity and short term return
              reversal. We argue that this is the case because these stocks
              have lottery-like characteristics, which is attractive to certain
              investors. Also, these stocks tend to be very volatile so that
              arbitrageurs are discouraged from correcting potential
              mispricing. As a consequence, these stocks are often overpriced
              and hence face lower expected returns. Second, when we control
              for extreme returns, the recently found negative relationship
              between idiosyncratic risk and future returns is less robust. In
              our models, after adding maximum returns, the relationship is
              insignificant and sometimes even positive. We also find that
              idiosyncratic skewness and coskewness play an important role for
              asset pricing, as predicted by several theoretical models.",

              motives, namely, strategic choices, altruism, and greenwashing,
              suggest that the relationship between CSR and FP is positive,
              non-negative, and non-existent, respectively. We obtained our
              sample, which covered 2003--2009, from the Ethical Investment
              Research Service (EIRIS) databank and Bankscope database. The
              data consists of 162 banks in 22 countries. We then classified
              the banks into four types based on their degree of engagement in
              CSR. This study proposes the use of an extended version of the
              Heckman two-step regression, in which the first step adopts a
              multinomial logit model, and the second step estimates the
              performance equation with the inverse Mills ratio generated by
              the first step. The empirical results show that CSR positively
              associates with FP in terms of return on assets, return on
              equity, net interest income, and non-interest income. In
              contrast, CSR negatively associates with non-performing loans.

              in CSR.",

              soccer bettors lose more money than others. Are soccer bettors
              with above average losses simply biased, or are their losses
              driven by betting on events that are inherently unpredictable? We
              confirm the existence of favourite-longshot bias in soccer in
              this sample, but find another surprising feature of betting on
              longshots. As measured by the Brier score, bookmakers' odds were
              better predictors of longshots than favourites, suggesting
              another potential channel whereby bettors' preference for betting

  abstract = "In sport tournaments in which teams are matched two at a time, it
              is useful for a variety of reasons to be able to quantify how
              important a particular game is. The need for such quantitative
              information has been addressed in the literature by several more
              or less simple measures of game importance. In this paper, we
              point out some of the drawbacks of those measures and we propose
              a different approach, which rather targets how decisive a game is
              with respect to the final victory. We give a definition of this
              idea of game decisiveness in terms of the uncertainty about the
              eventual winner prevailing in the tournament at the time of the
              game. As this uncertainty is strongly related to the notion of
              entropy of a probability distribution, our decisiveness measure
              is based on entropy-related concepts. We study the suggested
              decisiveness measure on two real tournaments, the 1988 NBA
              Championship Series and the UEFA 2012 European Football
              Championship (Euro 2012), and we show how well it agrees with
              what intuition suggests. Finally, we also use our decisiveness
              measure to objectively analyse the recent UEFA decision to expand
              the European Football Championship from 16 to 24 nations in the
              future, in terms of the overall attractiveness of the

              contemporaneous return-volatility relationship varies not only

              magnitude, according to recent results from the behavioral

  abstract = "A number of recent studies in the economics literature have
              focused on the usefulness of factor models in the context of
              prediction using ``big data'' (see Bai and Ng, 2008; Dufour and
              Stevanovic, 2010; Forni, Hallin, Lippi, \& Reichlin, 2000; Forni

              2006, 2012, and the references cited therein). We add to this
              literature by analyzing whether ``big data'' are useful for
              modelling low frequency macroeconomic variables, such as
              unemployment, inflation and GDP. In particular, we analyze the
              predictive benefits associated with the use of principal
              component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA),
              and sparse principal component analysis (SPCA). We also evaluate
              machine learning, variable selection and shrinkage methods,
              including bagging, boosting, ridge regression, least angle
              regression, the elastic net, and the non-negative garotte. Our
              approach is to carry out a forecasting ``horse-race'' using
              prediction models that are constructed based on a variety of
              model specification approaches, factor estimation methods, and
              data windowing methods, in the context of predicting 11
              macroeconomic variables that are relevant to monetary policy
              assessment. In many instances, we find that various of our
              benchmark models, including autoregressive (AR) models, AR models
              with exogenous variables, and (Bayesian) model averaging, do not
              dominate specifications based on factor-type dimension reduction
              combined with various machine learning, variable selection, and
              shrinkage methods (called ``combination'' models). We find that
              forecast combination methods are mean square forecast error
              (MSFE) ``best'' for only three variables out of 11 for a forecast
              horizon of h=1, and for four variables when h=3 or 12. In
              addition, non-PCA type factor estimation methods yield MSFE-best
              predictions for nine variables out of 11 for h=1, although PCA
              dominates at longer horizons. Interestingly, we also find
              evidence of the usefulness of combination models for
              approximately half of our variables when h>1. Most importantly,
              we present strong new evidence of the usefulness of factor-based

              Football Association League over the years 1992?1997 using
              refinements of the independent Poisson model of Dixon and Coles.
              Our framework assumes that each team has attack and defence
              strengths that evolve through time (rather than remaining
              constant) according to some unobserved bivariate stochastic
              process. Estimation of the teams' attack and defence capabilities
              is undertaken via a novel approach involving an approximation
              that is computationally convenient and fast. The results of this
              approximation compare very favourably with results obtained
              through the Dixon and Coles approach. We note that the full model
              (i.e. the model before the above approximation is made) may be
              implemented using Markov chain Monte Carlo procedures, and that
              this approach is vastly more computationally expensive. We focus
              on the probabilities of home win, draw or away win because these
              outcomes constitute the primary betting market. These
              probabilities are estimated for games played between any two of
              the 92 teams and the predictions are compared with the actual
              results.",

  author   = "Joseph, A and Fenton, N E and Neil, M",
  abstract = "Bayesian networks (BNs) provide a means for representing,
              displaying, and making available in a usable form the knowledge
              of experts in a given field. In this paper, we look at the
              performance of an expert constructed BN compared with other
              machine learning (ML) techniques for predicting the outcome (win,
              lose, or draw) of matches played by Tottenham Hotspur Football
              Club. The period under study was 1995--1997 -- the expert BN was
              constructed at the start of that period, based almost exclusively
              on subjective judgement. Our objective was to determine
              retrospectively the comparative accuracy of the expert BN
              compared to some alternative ML models that were built using data
              from the two-year period. The additional ML techniques considered
              were: MC4, a decision tree learner; Naive Bayesian learner; Data
              Driven Bayesian (a BN whose structure and node probability tables
              are learnt entirely from data); and a K-nearest neighbour
              learner. The results show that the expert BN is generally
              superior to the other techniques for this domain in predictive
              accuracy. The results are even more impressive for BNs given
              that, in a number of key respects, the study assumptions place
              them at a disadvantage. For example, we have assumed that the BN
              prediction is `incorrect' if a BN predicts more than one outcome
              as equally most likely (whereas, in fact, such a prediction would
              prove valuable to somebody who could place an `each way' bet on
              the outcome). Although the expert BN has now long been irrelevant
              (since it contains variables relating to key players who have
              retired or left the club) the results here tend to confirm the
              excellent potential of BNs when they are built by a reliable
              domain expert. The ability to provide accurate predictions
              without requiring much learning data are an obvious bonus in any
              domain where data are scarce. Moreover, the BN was relatively
              simple for the expert to build and its structure could be used
              again in this and similar types of problems.",

  abstract = "This paper proposes a non-parametric approach of a banking
              production technology that decomposes performance into economic
              and credit risk efficiencies. The basis of our approach is to
              separate the production technology into two sub-technologies. The
              former is the production of non-interest income and loans from a
              set of traditional inputs. The latter is attached to the
              production of interest income from loans where an explicit
              distinction between good and non-performing loans is introduced.
              Economic efficiency comes from the production of good outputs,
              namely interest and non-interest income, while credit risk
              management efficiency is related to the minimization of the
              non-performing loans that can be considered as an unintended or
              bad output. The model is applied to Chinese financial data
              covering 30 banks from 2005 to 2012 and different scenarios are

              decreased by an average rate of 33\%. According to our results,

               mechanism for organization learning and, thus, for organization
               adaptation. We argue that executive succession can fundamentally
               alter the knowledge, skills and interaction processes of the
               senior management team. These revised skills and communication
               processes improve the team's ability to recognize and act on
               changing environmental conditions. Especially in turbulent
               environments, succession may be critical for improving or
               sustaining the performance of the firm. We explore continuity
               and change of CEOs and their executive teams as associated with
               first- and second-order organization learning, which are
               differentially important under stable versus turbulent
               environmental conditions. We also link these organization
               learning ideas to the nature of organization evolution. A series
               of hypotheses link executive-team succession and strategic
               reorientation to subsequent organization performance. Results in
               a study of 59 minicomputer firms, all founded between 1968 and
               1971, indicate that succession exerts a positive influence on
               organization performance. We also show that it is important to
               distinguish between CEO succession and executive-team change,
               which independently improve subsequent organization performance.
               The positive impact of succession is accentuated when it
               coincides with strategic reorientation. Finally we examined how
               longer term patterns in succession and reorientation affect
               organization performance. We discovered two modes of
               organization adaption in this turbulent industry. The most
               typical mode combines CEO succession, sweeping executive-team
               changes, and strategic reorientations. A more rare, and over the
               long-term more effective, adaptational mode involves strategic
               reorientation and executive-team change, but no succession of
               the CEO. Consistently high-performing organizations are managed
               to sustain a relatively high level of learning (through turnover
               of senior executives and strategic reorientation), and at the
               same time to maintain links with established organizational

              introducing observable characteristics that instrument for the
              unobservable dynamic loadings. If the characteristics/expected
              return relationship is driven by compensation for exposure to

              characteristic effect is compensation without risk and allocates
              it to an ``anomaly'' intercept. Studying returns and

              to be allocated more efficiently. Recent work supports this
              notion. Bai, Philippon and Savov (2016) document an improvement
              in the ability of S\&P 500 equity prices to predict firms' future

              The mean of the process and the variances of the signal and noise
              are allowed to shift either suddenly or gradually at unknown

               corporate governance. Despite limited empirical evidence,
               duality (chairman of the board and CEO are the same individual)
               has been blamed, in many cases, for the poor performance, and

               examining the relationship between duality and firm performance,
               this study considers the announcement effects of changes in
               duality status, accounting measures of operating performance for
               firms that have changed their duality structure, and long-term
               measures of performance for firms that have had a consistent
               history of a duality structure. Our results suggest that: (1)
               the market is indifferent to changes in a firm's duality status;

               evidence that duality status affects long-term performance,

               Loosely speaking, it involves a statistical arbitrage tool for
               identifying and exploiting the inefficiencies of two long-term,
               related financial assets. When a significant deviation from this
               equilibrium is observed, a profit might result. In this paper,
               we propose a pairs trading strategy entirely based on linear
               state space models designed for modelling the spread formed with
               a pair of assets. Once an adequate state space model for the
               spread is estimated, we use the Kalman filter to calculate
               conditional probabilities that the spread will return to its
               long-term mean. The strategy is activated upon large values of
               these conditional probabilities: the spread is bought or sold
               accordingly. Two applications with real data from the US and
               Brazilian markets are offered, and even though they probably

              selection algorithm named the Wavelet de-noise Kalman Momentum
              anti-correlation algorithm (W-KACM), which can fully exploit the

              a improved measure of the cyclically adjusted price relative

              WKFPR, unlike the raw price relative that measures only how much
              the price moves from one period to the next, measures how far the
              price deviates from the inherent trend value. To demonstrate the
              effectiveness of our strategy, we extensively simulate on
              previously untested real market datasets, including Chinese stock
              market datasets, and make comparison with AC and KACM algorithms.
              The results of these experiments indicate that our strategy

               experts on the topic, An Introduction to Analysis of Financial
               Data with R explores basic concepts of visualization of
               financial data. Through a fundamental balance between theory and
               applications, the book supplies readers with an accessible
               approach to financial econometric models and their applications
               to real-world empirical research. The author supplies a hands-on
               introduction to the analysis of financial data using the freely
               available R software package and case studies to illustrate
               actual implementations of the discussed methods. The book begins
               with the basics of financial data, discussing their summary
               statistics and related visualization methods. Subsequent
               chapters explore basic time series analysis and simple
               econometric models for business, finance, and economics as well
               as related topics including: Linear time series analysis, with
               coverage of exponential smoothing for forecasting and methods
               for model comparison Different approaches to calculating asset
               volatility and various volatility models High-frequency
               financial data and simple models for price changes, trading
               intensity, and realized volatility Quantitative methods for risk
               management, including value at risk and conditional value at

               the book, the visual nature of the topic is showcased through
               graphical representations in R, and two detailed case studies
               demonstrate the relevance of statistics in finance. A related
               website features additional data sets and R scripts so readers
               can create their own simulations and test their comprehension of
               the presented techniques. An Introduction to Analysis of

               understanding of the world for centuries, yet we are all
               familiar with the way statistical claims can be sensationalised,
               particularly in the media. In the age of big data, as data

              The aim is to put them in a wider context, e.g., allowing for

              the face of the uncertainties. Important lessons can be drawn for

              conventional energy sources of coal, natural gas, and oil, does

               capital and take on less risk. Empirical evidence is found

  abstract  = "Our original reason for writing this book was the desire to
               write down in one place a complete summary of the major results
               in du ality theory pioneered by Ronald W. Shephard in three of
               his books, Cost and Production Functions (1953), Theory of Cost
               and Produc tion Functions (1970), and Indirect Production
               Functions (1974). In this way, newcomers to the field would have
               easy access to these important ideas. In adg,ition, we report a
               few new results of our own. In particular, we show the duality
               relationship between the profit function and the eight
               equivalent representations of technol ogy that were elucidated
               by Shephard. However, in planning the book and discussing it
               with colleagues it became evident that such a book would be more
               useful if it also provided a number of applications of
               Shephard's duality theory to economic problems. Thus, we have
               also attempted to present exam ples of the use of duality theory
               in areas such as efficiency measure ment, index number theory,
               shadow pricing, cost-benefit analysis, and econometric
               estimation. Much of our thinking about duality theory and its
               uses has been influenced by our present and former
               collaborators. They include Charles Blackorby, Shawna Grosskopf,
               Knox Lovell, Robert Russell, and, not surprisingly, Ronald W.
               Shephard. We have also benefit ted over the years from many
               discussions with W. Erwin Diewert.",

               regression problems arise in operations research, economics, and
               other disciplines in which imposing a convexity constraint on

  abstract  = "The field of productive efficiency analysis is currently divided
               between two main paradigms: the deterministic, nonparametric
               Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and the parametric Stochastic
               Frontier Analysis (SFA). This paper examines an encompassing
               semiparametric frontier model that combines the DEA-type
               nonparametric frontier, which satisfies monotonicity and
               concavity, with the SFA-style stochastic homoskedastic composite
               error term. To estimate this model, a new two-stage method is
               proposed, referred to as Stochastic Non-smooth Envelopment of
               Data (StoNED). The first stage of the StoNED method applies
               convex nonparametric least squares (CNLS) to estimate the shape
               of the frontier without any assumptions about its functional
               form or smoothness. In the second stage, the conditional
               expectations of inefficiency are estimated based on the CNLS
               residuals, using the method of moments or pseudolikelihood
               techniques. Although in a cross-sectional setting distinguishing
               inefficiency from noise in general requires distributional
               assumptions, we also show how these can be relaxed in our
               approach if panel data are available. Performance of the StoNED

               emphasized the importance of retrospective analysis and review
               of existing federal rules, I survey the state of retrospective
               analysis and review of federal regulations. I first ask how much
               is known about the economic merit of past federal regulatory
               decisions, based on retrospective economic analyses of their
               effects. I review reports of the Office of Management and Budget
               and related literature, but unlike those reports I find only
               five rules, issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety
               Administration (NHTSA), for which retrospective analyses provide
               estimates of both costs and reasonably good proxies for benefits
               (e.g., adverse health effects avoided). Other retrospective
               studies of federal rules estimate are incomplete, estimating
               only the compliance costs, or only the benefits, or only costs
               and measures of effectiveness, like emissions reductions, which
               do not closely relate to people's welfare.I also seek to explain
               differences in the practice of retrospective analysis and review
               between NHTSA, which appears to have the best record of
               retrospective analyses among federal agencies, and the
               Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), an important regulatory
               agency. I find that NHTSA regularly conducts such analyses and
               reviews, while EPA rarely does retrospective analysis and
               presents rulemakings that look like business as usual as being
               the result of a retrospective review. I analyze the role of data
               limitations, statutory authority, and institutional incentives
               in influencing the different behaviors of these two agencies. I
               conclude that differences in data availability and in particular
               the lack of relevant control groups, are an important barrier to
               retrospective analysis at EPA. This data deficiency, combined
               with important restrictions on EPA's ability to consider
               information on net benefits or cost-effectiveness in its
               rule-making, are together the biggest hindrance to generating
               better information about the effects of its rules. I conclude
               with recommendations intended to generate more measurement of
               the actual effects of regulations.",

  abstract = "The Law of One Price (LoOP) states that all firms face the same
              prices for their inputs and outputs under market equilibrium.
              Taken here as a normative condition for `efficiency prices', this
              law has powerful implications for productive efficiency analysis,
              which have remained unexploited thus far. This paper shows how
              LoOP-based weight restrictions can be incorporated in Data
              Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Utilizing the relation between
              industry-level and firm-level cost efficiency measures, we
              propose to apply a set of input prices that is common for all
              firms and that maximizes the cost efficiency of the industry. Our
              framework allows for firm-specific output weights and for
              variable returns-to-scale, and preserves the linear programming
              structure of the standard DEA. We apply the proposed methodology

               increasing and globally concave functions that can be
               nondifferentiable. We show that this family of functions can be
               characterized without a loss of generality by a subset of
               continuous, piece-wise linear functions whose intercept and
               slope coefficients are constrained to satisfy the required
               monotonicity and concavity conditions. This representation

               us to derive an explicit representation for the regression

               algorithms and solver software. Importantly, the QP formulation

              for control of CO2, assuming that the control of each of the

              control of CO2, SO2, and NOX emissions is most appropriately

  abstract = "Abstract The role of the environment is an important issue in the
              policy-making and hence, the accurate assessment of the
              environmental conditions is vital. In this paper, an
              environmental efficiency index is developed for the OECD
              countries using non-parametric techniques. The approach adopted
              is based on the assumption that there is just one production
              process behind the production of both goods and pollution
              emissions. The index derived in this work measures the extent of
              the required output sacrifice, due to the transformation of the
              production process, from one where all outputs are strongly
              disposable to the one which is characterized by weak
              disposability of pollutants. Using this index, we first conduct
              cross-section comparisons on the state of each country's
              production process in its treatment of pollution emissions. We
              then trace each country's modification of their production
              processes overtime. The results indicate that if the
              disposability for CO2emissions were strictly restricted as the
              result of an environmental regulation, the total value of output
              loss to the OECD countries as a whole would correspond to 3.7,

              production framework without considering undesirable outputs.
              However, energy use results in the generation of undesirable

              models for measuring economy-wide energy efficiency performance.
              In addition to considering undesirable outputs, our models treat
              different energy sources as different inputs so that changes in
              energy mix could be accounted for in evaluating energy

              First, by destroying the capital of firms and reducing their

              the liquidity of firms, leading to a higher rate of default that

              models vary substantially with respect to the aspects of

              review different modelling families and compare these

              capital-to-net income ratio and the net of depreciation share of
              income to capital, a measure of wealth concentration and income
              distribution between capital and labour respectively, over the
              next two centuries. If climate change only directly affects
              production, as usually assumed, the capital-to-net income ratio
              will increase as compared to what it would be in the absence of
              climate change. The capital-to-income ratio will increase even
              further if climate change affects labour productivity. In both
              cases, the increase in the ratio after 2100 is due to the stock
              of capital being depleted at a lower rate than net income is
              falling. However, the capital-to-net income ratio will be lower
              and eventually fall if damage from climate change increases the
              depreciation rate of capital; this decline is marginally reduced
              if climate change impacts both capital and labour productivity.
              In the case where climate change impacts the depreciation of
              capital, the ratio after 2100 is falling because the stock of
              capital is destroyed faster than net-income is falling.
              Furthermore, climate change reduces the net share of income
              accruing to capital in all scenarios with dramatic changes in the
              case of climate change affecting the depreciation of capital.

               rules for the oversight of their administrated credit unions. We
               analyze the importance of the Basel III additional capital
               buffer requirements for credit union prudential regulation.
               Based on a sample of the 100 largest credit unions in Canada
               from 1996 to 2014, we find that Canadian credit union capital
               buffers behave countercyclically over the business cycle.
               Further, credit unions hold a capital buffer bigger than the
               maximum buffer advocated under Basel III which is 5\% of
               risk-weighted assets (RWA). These results suggest that, unlike
               commercial banks worldwide, credit unions, by and large, are
               already in compliance with the new Basel III buffer
               requirements. However, there is evidence that the capital
               buffers of low-capitalized credit unions are procyclical. These
               credit unions increased their RWA during booms but failed to
               build up additional capital accordingly. Hence, weakly

  abstract = "We surveyed all articles in the Journal of Personality and Social
              Psychology (JPSP), Psychological Science (PS), and the Journal of
              Experimental Psychology: General (JEP:G) that mentioned the term
              ``Likert,'' and found that 100\% of the articles that analyzed
              ordinal data did so using a metric model. We present novel
              evidence that analyzing ordinal data as if they were metric can
              systematically lead to errors. We demonstrate false alarms (i.e.,
              detecting an effect where none exists, Type I errors) and
              failures to detect effects (i.e., loss of power, Type II errors).
              We demonstrate systematic inversions of effects, for which
              treating ordinal data as metric indicates the opposite ordering
              of means than the true ordering of means. We show the same
              problems --- false alarms, misses, and inversions --- for
              interactions in factorial designs and for trend analyses in
              regression. We demonstrate that averaging across multiple ordinal
              measurements does not solve or even ameliorate these problems. A
              central contribution is a graphical explanation of how and when
              the misrepresentations occur. Moreover, we point out that there
              is no sure-fire way to detect these problems by treating the
              ordinal values as metric, and instead we advocate use of
              ordered-probit models (or similar) because they will better
              describe the data. Finally, although frequentist approaches to
              some ordered-probit models are available, we use Bayesian methods
              because of their flexibility in specifying models and their
              richness and accuracy in providing parameter estimates. An R
              script is provided for running an analysis that compares
              ordered-probit and metric models.",

               of the details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in
               your own modeling work. The text presents causal inference and
               generalized linear multilevel models from a simple Bayesian
               perspective that builds on information theory and maximum
               entropy. The core material ranges from the basics of regression
               to advanced multilevel models. It also presents measurement
               error, missing data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and
               phylogenetic confounding. The second edition emphasizes the
               directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach to causal inference,
               integrating DAGs into many examples. The new edition also
               contains new material on the design of prior distributions,
               splines, ordered categorical predictors, social relations
               models, cross-validation, importance sampling, instrumental

              alternatives to more familiar valuation techniques based on
              stated preferences such as the contingent valuation method. A

               of individuals and organizations using attitudinal scales such
               as degree of satisfaction or importance attached to an issue.
               Examples include levels of obesity, seriousness of a health

               products, voting intentions, and the degree of clarity of

               for capturing the sources of influence that explain the choice
               made amongst a set of ordered alternatives. The methods have
               evolved to a level of sophistication that can allow for

              the European banking sector during the various stages of the
              Basel process of capital regulation. In the first part we
              document the evolution of various measures of systemic risk as
              the Basel process unfolds. Most strikingly, we find that the
              exposure to systemic risk as measured by SRISK has been steeply
              rising for the highest quintile, moderately rising for the second
              quintile and remaining roughly stationary for the remaining three
              quintiles of listed European banks. This observation suggests
              that the Basel process has succeeded in containing systemic risk
              for the majority of European banks but not for the largest
              institutions. In the second part we analyse the drivers of
              systemic risk. We find compelling evidence that the increase in
              exposure to systemic risk (SRISK) is intimately tied to the
              implementation of internal models for determining credit risk as
              well as market risk. Based on this evidence, the sub-prime crisis
              found especially the largest and more systemic banks ill-prepared
              and lacking resiliency. This condition has even aggravated during
              the European sovereign crisis. Banking Union has not (yet)
              brought about a significant increase in the safety and soundness
              of the European banking system. Finally, low interest rates

                   including attention and memory, unsupervised learning,
                   transfer learning, multi-agent RL, hierarchical RL, and
                   learning to learn. Then we discuss various applications of
                   RL, including games, in particular, AlphaGo, robotics,
                   natural language processing, including dialogue systems,

  abstract      = "The nascent field of fair machine learning aims to ensure
                   that decisions guided by algorithms are equitable. Over the
                   last several years, three formal definitions of fairness
                   have gained prominence: (1) anti-classification, meaning
                   that protected attributes---like race, gender, and their
                   proxies---are not explicitly used to make decisions; (2)
                   classification parity, meaning that common measures of
                   predictive performance (e.g., false positive and false
                   negative rates) are equal across groups defined by the
                   protected attributes; and (3) calibration, meaning that
                   conditional on risk estimates, outcomes are independent of
                   protected attributes. Here we show that all three of these
                   fairness definitions suffer from significant statistical
                   limitations. Requiring anti-classification or classification
                   parity can, perversely, harm the very groups they were
                   designed to protect; and calibration, though generally
                   desirable, provides little guarantee that decisions are
                   equitable. In contrast to these formal fairness criteria, we
                   argue that it is often preferable to treat similarly risky
                   people similarly, based on the most statistically accurate
                   estimates of risk that one can produce. Such a strategy,
                   while not universally applicable, often aligns well with
                   policy objectives; notably, this strategy will typically
                   violate both anti-classification and classification parity.
                   In practice, it requires significant effort to construct
                   suitable risk estimates. One must carefully define and
                   measure the targets of prediction to avoid retrenching
                   biases in the data. But, importantly, one cannot generally
                   address these difficulties by requiring that algorithms
                   satisfy popular mathematical formalizations of fairness. By
                   highlighting these challenges in the foundation of fair
                   machine learning, we hope to help researchers and
                   practitioners productively advance the area.",

                   conditions in training differ from those in test. Recent

                   While many such models have been proposed, there have been

                   achieve their intended effects, such as encouraging people
                   to follow the model's predictions when the model is correct
                   and to deviate when it makes a mistake. We present a series
                   of randomized, pre-registered experiments comprising 3,800
                   participants in which people were shown functionally
                   identical models that varied only in two factors thought to
                   influence interpretability: the number of input features and
                   the model transparency (clear or black-box). Predictably,
                   participants who were shown a clear model with a small
                   number of features were better able to simulate the model's
                   predictions. However, contrary to what one might expect when
                   manipulating interpretability, we found no improvements in
                   the degree to which participants followed the model's
                   predictions when it was beneficial to do so. Even more
                   surprisingly, increased transparency hampered people's
                   ability to detect when the model makes a sizable mistake and
                   correct for it, seemingly due to information overload. These
                   counterintuitive results suggest that decision scientists
                   creating interpretable models should harbor a healthy
                   skepticism of their intuitions and empirically verify that

                   argues that a major reason why software is often poorly
                   designed (from a user perspective) is that programmers are
                   in charge of design decisions, rather than interaction
                   designers. As a result, programmers design software for
                   themselves, rather than for their target audience, a
                   phenomenon he refers to as the `inmates running the asylum'.
                   This paper argues that explainable AI risks a similar fate.
                   While the re-emergence of explainable AI is positive, this
                   paper argues most of us as AI researchers are building
                   explanatory agents for ourselves, rather than for the
                   intended users. But explainable AI is more likely to succeed

                   parameters are not interpretable. In this paper, we
                   re-examine the internal representations of DNNs using
                   adversarial images, which are generated by an
                   ensemble-optimization algorithm. We find that: (1) the

                   but respond to objects/parts only as recurrent

  abstract  = "Taking three recent business books on artificial intelligence
               (AI) as a starting point, we explore the automation and
               augmentation concepts in the management domain. Whereas
               automation implies that machines take over a human task,
               augmentation means that humans collaborate closely with machines
               to perform a task. Taking a normative stance, the three books
               advise organizations to prioritize augmentation, which they
               relate to superior performance. Using a more comprehensive
               paradox perspective, we argue that, in the management domain,
               augmentation cannot be neatly separated from automation. These
               dual AI applications are interdependent across time and space,
               creating a paradoxical tension. Over-emphasizing either
               augmentation or automation fuels reinforcing cycles with
               negative organizational and societal outcomes. However, if
               organizations adopt a broader perspective comprising both
               automation and augmentation, they could deal with the tension
               and achieve complementarities that benefit business and society.
               Drawing on our insights, we conclude that management scholars
               need to be involved in research on the use of AI in
               organizations. We also argue that a substantial change is

              research has evaluated bankruptcy using traditional statistics
              techniques (e.g. discriminant analysis and logistic regression)
              and early artificial intelligence models (e.g. artificial neural
              networks). In this study, we test machine learning models
              (support vector machines, bagging, boosting, and random forest)
              to predict bankruptcy one year prior to the event, and compare
              their performance with results from discriminant analysis,
              logistic regression, and neural networks. We use data from 1985
              to 2013 on North American firms, integrating information from the
              Salomon Center database and Compustat, analysing more than 10,000
              firm-year observations. The key insight of the study is a
              substantial improvement in prediction accuracy using machine
              learning techniques especially when, in addition to the original
              Altman's Z-score variables, we include six complementary
              financial indicators. Based on Carton and Hofer (2006), we use
              new variables, such as the operating margin, change in
              return-on-equity, change in price-to-book, and growth measures
              related to assets, sales, and number of employees, as predictive
              variables. Machine learning models show, on average,
              approximately 10\% more accuracy in relation to traditional
              models. Comparing the best models, with all predictive variables,
              the machine learning technique related to random forest led to
              87\% accuracy, whereas logistic regression and linear
              discriminant analysis led to 69\% and 50\% accuracy,

              techniques, and that all prediction accuracy in the testing
              sample improves when the additional variables are included. Our
              research adds to the discussion of the continuing debate about
              superiority of computational methods over statistical techniques
              such as in Tsai, Hsu, and Yen (2014) and Yeh, Chi, and Lin

  abstract = "Convolutional neural networks are being applied to identification
              problems in a variety of fields, and in some areas are showing
              higher discrimination accuracies than conventional methods.
              However, applications of convolutional neural networks to
              financial analyses have only been reported in a small number of
              studies on the prediction of stock price movements. The reason
              for this seems to be that convolutional neural networks are more
              suitable for application to images and less suitable for general
              numerical data including financial statements. Hence, in this
              research, an attempt is made to apply a convolutional neural
              network to the prediction of corporate bankruptcy, which in most
              cases is treated as a two-class classification problem. We use
              the financial statements (balance sheets and profit-and-loss
              statements) of 102 companies that have been delisted from the
              Japanese stock market due to de facto bankruptcy as well as the
              financial statements of 2062 currently listed companies over four
              financial periods. In our proposed method, a set of financial
              ratios are derived from the financial statements and represented
              as a grayscale image. The image generated by this process is
              utilized for training and testing a convolutional neural network.
              Moreover, the size of the dataset is increased using the weighted
              averages to create synthetic data points. A total of 7520 images
              for the bankrupt and continuing enterprises classes are used for
              training the convolutional neural network based on GoogLeNet.
              Bankruptcy predictions through the trained network are shown to
              have a higher performance compared to methods using decision
              trees, linear discriminant analysis, support vector machines,

               Our framework assumes that each team has attack and defence

               constant) according to some unobserved bivariate stochastic

              that the yield curve fails to span realized yield volatility in

              are largely unrelated to the cross-section of yields. We conclude
              that a broad class of affine diffusive, quadratic Gaussian, and
              affine jump-diffusive models cannot accommodate the observed
              yield volatility dynamics. Hence, the Treasury market per se is

              correlations are fundamentally different from other measures of

               monetary integration. More specifically, I quantify the

               the aggregate European (EU) and U.S. market to 13 local European
               equity markets. To account for time-varying integration, I use a
               regime-switching model to allow the shock sensitivites to change
               over time. I find regime switches to be both statistically and
               economically important. Both the EU and U.S. shock spillover
               intensity increased substantially over the 1980s and 1990s,

               spillover intensities increased most strongly in the second half
               of the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s. I show that
               increased trade integration, equity market development, and low

              medium-sized firms. A not-for-profit orientation (in many cases)

              enduring popularity and sustainability of financial cooperatives.
              This is particularly evident since the global financial crisis

              bank efficiency but the benefits of diversification are offset by
              the increased exposure to volatile non-interest activities. With
              respect to the impact of ownership, we find that state-owned
              banks with fewer volatile income sources are likely to be less
              efficient in terms of income diversification. Our results also
              reveal that more diversified foreign-owned banks tend to be less

              ownership of banks appears to improve the diversification

              governance features (size, composition and functioning) on bank
              efficiency and risk taking. Our evidence suggests that board
              characteristics tend to have a greater influence on banks' profit

              traditional banking risk. Similarly, board independence is
              associated with higher profit efficiency of banks; while the

              dual leadership of the CEO/chairperson. Among the control

               developments in real estate markets can cause instability in the
               banking sector and raised concerns in many emerging economies
               with significant real estate development and a rapidly growing
               commercial banking sector, particularly in China. There is clear
               evidence that commercial banks in China, especially regional
               commercial banks, have lent significantly to the real estate
               sector. The recent slowdown in the housing market in China and
               the increase in nonperforming loans (NPLs) in China's commercial
               banking sector motivated us to investigate the connection
               between real estate markets and banking stability. This paper
               proposes three testable hypotheses linking the growth of
               investment in real estate and the stability of regional
               commercial banks in China, measured by NPLs. Our empirical
               results reveal a close connection between the growth of
               investment in real estate and the NPLs among regional commercial
               banks, and its sensitivity to real estate market cycles. When
               real estate market activity declines, our results suggest,
               regional commercial banks can find themselves in trouble if they
               have significant exposure to one type of (real estate) asset. In

               independent trials and determining the variance across those

               to allow others to evaluate the effect that multiple testing has
               had on reported performance. He applies his method to a real

              are asymptotically centered at the MLE, normal, and of asymptotic
              variance that is, in general, different than the sandwich matrix.
              It is shown that due to this discrepancy, Bayesian inference
              about the pseudo-true parameter value is, in general, of lower
              asymptotic frequentist risk when the original posterior is
              substituted by an artificial normal posterior centered at the MLE

               effects from the dynamic effects. In a second level of the

               promotional price elasticity, and the long-term regular price
               elasticity are correlated with various brand-specific and
               category-specific characteristics. The model is applied to seven
               years of data on weekly sales of 100 different brands in 25

              information on a broad range of instruments which are tracked
              over their life cycle. Using a dynamic panel framework at a
              monthly frequency enables us to assess the impact of
              macroprudential tools and their design on the banks' systemic
              risk both in the short and the long run. We furthermore decompose
              the systemic risk measure in an individual bank risk component
              and a systemic linkage component. This is of particular interest
              because microprudential policy focuses on the tail risk of an
              individual bank while macroprudential policy targets systemic
              risk by addressing the interlinkages and common exposures across
              banks. On average, all banks benefit from macroprudential tools

              financial cooperatives. In this part we consider, the origin and
              diffusion of financial cooperatives, network arrangements, the
              business model, relationship banking, balancing the interest of
              members, tax treatment and regulatory framework. The second part
              has performance and contribution to the real economy as the
              overarching theme. In this part we consider, efficiency and
              sustainability, mergers, acquisitions and failures, the benefits
              (and challenges) of FinTech and the contribution of financial
              cooperatives to the real economy including during times of
              crisis. The paper concludes with a summary of what we now know
              (and do not know) about financial cooperatives and provides
              suggestions as to where future research may usefully concentrate.",

              on the stock returns of U.S. financial and FinTech institutions,
              we estimate pairwise risk spillovers by using the Granger
              causality test across quantiles. We consider the whole
              distribution: the left tail (bearish case), the right tail
              (bullish case) and the center of the distribution and construct
              three types of spillover networks (downside-to-downside,
              upside-to-upside, and center-to-center) and obtain network-based
              spillover indicators. We find that linkages in the network are
              stronger in the bearish case when the risk of spillover is
              higher. FinTech institutions' risk spillover to financial
              institutions positively correlates with financial institutions'
              increase in systemic risk. These results have important policy

                 in general the influence of bank-specific factors is lower

                   the result of the temporary market impact caused by waves of
                   buyers and sellers. This price behavior can be approximated
                   through an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (O-U) process. Market makers
                   provide liquidity in an attempt to monetize this
                   oscillation. They enter a long position when a security is
                   priced below its estimated equilibrium level, and they enter
                   a short position when a security is priced above its
                   estimated equilibrium level. They hold that position until
                   one of three outcomes occur: (1) they achieve the targeted
                   profit; (2) they experience a maximum tolerated loss; (3)
                   the position is held beyond a maximum tolerated horizon. All

                   determine at what levels an order must be fulfilled. Those

  abstract = "One of the most exciting recent developments in financial
              research is the availability of new administrative, private
              sector and micro-level datasets that did not exist a few years
              ago. The unstructured nature of many of these observations, along
              with the complexity of the phenomena they measure, means that
              many of these datasets are beyond the grasp of econometric
              analysis. Machine learning (ML) techniques offer the numerical
              power and functional flexibility needed to identify complex
              patterns in a high-dimensional space. However, ML is often
              perceived as a black box, in contrast with the transparency of
              econometric approaches. This article demonstrates that each
              analytical step of the econometric process has a homologous step
              in ML analyses. By clearly stating this correspondence, our goal
              is to facilitate and reconcile the adoption of ML techniques
              among econometricians.",

               Mathematical Society on ?Fortune's Formula: The Game of
               Blackjack?. This announced the discovery of favorable card
               counting systems for blackjack. My 1962 book Beat the Dealer
               explained the detailed theory and practice. The ?optimal? way to
               bet in favorable situations was an important feature. In Beat
               the Dealer, I called this, naturally enough, ?The Kelly gambling
               system?, since I learned about it from the 1956 paper by John L.
               Kelly (Claude Shannon, who refereed the Kelly paper, brought it
               to my attention in November of 1960). I have continued to use it
               successfully in gambling and in investing. Since 1966, I've
               called it ?the Kelly Criterion?. The rising tide of theory about
               and practical use of the Kelly Criterion by several leading
               money managers received further impetus from William
               Poundstone's readable book about the Kelly Criterion, Fortune's
               Formula. (As this title came from that of my 1961 talk, I was
               asked to approve the use of the title) . At a value investor's
               conference held in Los Angeles in May, 2007, my son reported

               money, i.e., how much to bet. In the stock market (more
               inclusively, the securities markets) the problem is similar but
               more complex. The gambler, who is now an ?investor?, looks for
               ?excess risk adjusted return?. In both these settings, we
               explore the use of the Kelly criterion, which is to maximize the

               logarithmic utility?). The criterion is known to economists and

               which the underlying stochastic process has parameter values

               maximizing logarithmic utility when the underlying stochastic
               process is a simple random walk in a random environment, we show
               that a state-dependent control is optimal, which is a
               generalization of the celebrated Kelly strategy: the optimal
               strategy is to bet a fraction of current wealth equal to a
               linear function of the posterior mean increment. To approximate
               more general stochastic processes, we consider a continuous-time
               analog involving Brownian motion. To analyze the continuous-time
               problem, we study the diffusion limit of random walks in a
               random environment. We prove that they converge weakly to a
               Kiefer process, or tied-down Brownian sheet. We then find
               conditions under which the discrete-time process converges to a
               diffusion, and analyze the resulting process. We analyze in
               detail the case of the natural conjugate prior, where the
               success probability has a beta distribution, and show that the
               resulting limit diffusion can be viewed as a rescaled Brownian
               motion. These results allow explicit computation of the optimal
               control policies for the continuous-time gambling and investment
               problems without resorting to continuous-time stochastic-control
               procedures. Moreover they also allow an explicit quantitative

              econometric and financial studies, we consider the case where
              covariate dependence can be reduced through the factor model, and
              propose a consistency strategy named Factor-Adjusted Regularized

              the false discovery proportion (FDP) often ignore the effect of
              heavy-tailedness and the dependence structure among test
              statistics, and thus may lead to inefficient or even inconsistent
              estimation. Also, the commonly imposed joint normality assumption

               The ?lasso? minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the
               sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a
               constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to
               produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives
               interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the
               lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset
               selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models
               like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge
               regression. There is also an interesting relationship with
               recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and
               Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in
               a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized

              (?lasso?) has been widely used in regression shrinkage and

              autoregressive errors. Two types of lasso estimators are
              carefully studied. The first is similar to the traditional lasso
              estimator with only two tuning parameters (one for regression
              coefficients and the other for autoregression coefficients).
              These tuning parameters can be easily calculated via a
              data-driven method, but the resulting lasso estimator may not be
              fully efficient. To overcome this limitation, we propose a second
              lasso estimator which uses different tuning parameters for each
              coefficient. We show that this modified lasso can produce the
              estimator as efficiently as the oracle. Moreover, we propose an
              algorithm for tuning parameter estimates to obtain the modified
              lasso estimator. Simulation studies demonstrate that the modified
              estimator is superior to the traditional estimator. One empirical
              example is also presented to illustrate the usefulness of lasso
              estimators. The extension of the lasso to the autoregression with
              exogenous variables model is briefly discussed.",

               regression and classification. Two key mixture representations
               for the Bayesian bridge model are developed: a scale mixture of
               normal distributions with respect to an »-stable random
               variable; a mixture of Bartlett--Fejer kernels (or triangle
               densities) with respect to a two-component mixture of gamma
               random variables. Both lead to Markov chain Monte Carlo methods
               for posterior simulation, and these methods turn out to have
               complementary domains of maximum efficiency. The first
               representation is a well-known result due to West and is the
               better choice for collinear design matrices. The second
               representation is new and is more efficient for orthogonal
               problems, largely because it avoids the need to deal with
               exponentially tilted stable random variables. It also provides
               insight into the multimodality of the joint posterior
               distribution, which is a feature of the bridge model that is
               notably absent under ridge or lasso-type priors. We prove a
               theorem that extends this representation to a wider class of
               densities representable as scale mixtures of beta distributions,
               and we provide an explicit inversion formula for the mixing
               distribution. The connections with slice sampling and scale
               mixtures of normal distributions are explored. On the practical
               side, we find that the Bayesian bridge model outperforms its
               classical cousin in estimation and prediction across a variety
               of data sets, both simulated and real. We also show that the
               Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for fitting the bridge model
               exhibits excellent mixing properties, particularly for the
               global scale parameter. This makes for a favourable contrast
               with analogous Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for other
               sparse Bayesian models. All methods described in this paper are

               scientists in the field of quantitative finance. Machine
               Learning in Finance: From Theory to Practice is divided into
               three parts, each part covering theory and applications. The
               first presents supervised learning for cross-sectional data from
               both a Bayesian and frequentist perspective. The more advanced
               material places a firm emphasis on neural networks, including
               deep learning, as well as Gaussian processes, with examples in
               investment management and derivative modeling. The second part
               presents supervised learning for time series data, arguably the
               most common data type used in finance with examples in trading,
               stochastic volatility and fixed income modeling. Finally, the
               third part presents reinforcement learning and its applications
               in trading, investment and wealth management. Python code
               examples are provided to support the readers' understanding of
               the methodologies and applications. The book also includes more
               than 80 mathematical and programming exercises, with worked
               solutions available to instructors. As a bridge to research in
               this emergent field, the final chapter presents the frontiers of
               machine learning in finance from a researcher's perspective,
               highlighting how many well-known concepts in statistical physics

  author   = "Schneider, Eric B",
  abstract = "Economic historians have long been aware of many forms of bias
              that could lead to spurious causal inferences. However, our
              approach to these biases has been muddled at times by dealing
              with each bias separately and by confusion about the sources of
              bias and how to mitigate them. This paper shows how the
              methodology of directed acyclical graphs (DAGs) formulated by
              Pearl (2009) and particularly the concept of collider bias can
              provide economic historians with a unified approach to managing a
              wide range of biases that can distort causal inference. I present
              ten examples of collider bias drawn from economic history
              research, focussing mainly on examples where the authors were
              able to overcome or mitigate the bias. Thus, the paper addresses
              how to diagnose collider bias and also strategies for managing
              it. The paper also shows that quasi-random experimental designs
              are rarely able to overcome collider bias. Although all of these
              biases were understood by economic historians before,
              conceptualising them as collider bias will improve economic
              historians' understanding of the limitations of particular
              sources and help us develop better research designs in the

               financial innovations in decades. An ETF is an investment
               vehicle, with a specific architecture that typically seeks to
               track the performance of a specific index. The first US-listed
               ETF, the SPDR, was launched by State Street in January 1993 and
               seeks to track the S\&P 500 index. It is still today the largest
               ETF by far, with assets of \$178 billion. Following the
               introduction of the SPDR, new ETFs were launched tracking broad
               domestic and international indices, and more specialized sector,
               region, or country indexes. In recent years, ETFs have grown
               substantially in assets, diversity, and market significance,
               including substantial increases in assets in bond ETFs and
               so-called ``smart beta'' funds that track certain investment

               funds. In this paper, we begin by describing the structure and

               potential advantages in terms of liquidity, lower expenses, tax
               efficiency, and transparency. We then turn to concerns over
               whether the rise in ETFs may raise unexpected risks for
               investors or greater instability in financial markets. While
               concerns over financial fragility are worth serious

               and the CEO gets...a multi-million-dollar raise. This story is
               familiar, for good reason: as this book clearly demonstrates,
               structural flaws in corporate governance have produced
               widespread distortions in executive pay. Pay without Performance
               presents a disconcerting portrait of managers' influence over
               their own pay--and of a governance system that must
               fundamentally change if firms are to be managed in the interest
               of shareholders. Lucian Bebchuk and Jesse Fried demonstrate that
               corporate boards have persistently failed to negotiate at arm's
               length with the executives they are meant to oversee. They give
               a richly detailed account of how pay practices--from option
               plans to retirement benefits--have decoupled compensation from
               performance and have camouflaged both the amount and
               performance-insensitivity of pay. Executives' unwonted influence
               over their compensation has hurt shareholders by increasing pay
               levels and, even more importantly, by leading to practices that
               dilute and distort managers' incentives. This book identifies
               basic problems with our current reliance on boards as guardians
               of shareholder interests. And the solution, the authors argue,
               is not merely to make these boards more independent of
               executives as recent reforms attempt to do. Rather, boards
               should also be made more dependent on shareholders by
               eliminating the arrangements that entrench directors and
               insulate them from their shareholders. A powerful critique of
               executive compensation and corporate governance, Pay without

                   approximate difficult-to-compute probability densities. This
                   problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics,
                   which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a
                   calculation involving the posterior density. In this paper,
                   we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine
                   learning that approximates probability densities through
                   optimization. VI has been used in many applications and
                   tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov
                   chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first
                   posit a family of densities and then to find the member of
                   that family which is close to the target. Closeness is
                   measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas
                   behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special
                   case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a
                   full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and
                   derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale

              Laboratory (LBNL). The main objective of CIFT is to promote the
              use of high-performance computing (HPC) tools and techniques for
              analysis of streaming data. After noticing the data volume being
              given as the explanation for the five-month delay for SEC and
              CFTC to issue their report on the 2010 Flash Crash, LBNL started
              the CIFT project to apply HPC technologies to manage and analyze
              financial data. Making timely decisions with streaming data is a
              requirement for many different applications, such as avoiding
              impending failure in the electric power grid or a liquidity
              crisis in financial markets. In all these cases, the HPC tools
              are well suited in handling the complex data dependencies and
              providing timely solutions. Over the years, CIFT has worked on a
              number of different forms of streaming data, including those from
              vehicle traffic, electric power grid, electricity usage, and so
              on. The following sections explain the key features of HPC
              systems, introduce a few special tools used on these systems, and

  title     = "Theory of Rational Option Pricing",
  author    = "Merton, Robert C",
  abstract  = "[The long history of the theory of option pricing began in 1900
               when the French mathematician Louis Bachelier deduced an option
               pricing formula based on the assumption that stock prices follow
               a Brownian motion with zero drift. Since that time, numerous
               researchers have contributed to the theory. The present paper
               begins by deducing a set of restrictions on option pricing
               formulas from the assumption that investors prefer more to less.
               These restrictions are necessary conditions for a formula to be
               consistent with a rational pricing theory. Attention is given to
               the problems created when dividends are paid on the underlying
               common stock and when the terms of the option contract can be
               changed explicitly by a change in exercise price or implicitly
               by a shift in the investment or capital structure policy of the
               firm. Since the deduced restrictions are not sufficient to
               uniquely determine an option pricing formula, additional
               assumptions are introduced to examine and extend the seminal
               Black-Scholes theory of option pricing. Explicit formulas for
               pricing both call and put options as well as for warrants and
               the new ``down-and-out'' option are derived. The effects of
               dividends and call provisions on the warrant price are examined.
               The possibilities for further extension of the theory to the
               pricing of corporate liabilities are discussed.]",

              confounding to estimate causal effects. We discuss the following
              ten pitfalls and tips that are easily overlooked when using DAGs:
              1) Each node on DAGs corresponds to a random variable and not its
              realized values; 2) The presence or absence of arrows in DAGs
              corresponds to the presence or absence of individual causal
              effect in the population; 3) ``Non-manipulable'' variables and
              their arrows should be drawn with care; 4) It is preferable to
              draw DAGs for the total population, rather than for the exposed
              or unexposed groups; 5) DAGs are primarily useful to examine the
              presence of confounding in distribution in the notion of
              confounding in expectation; 6) Although DAGs provide qualitative
              differences of causal structures, they cannot describe details of
              how to adjust for confounding; 7) DAGs can be used to illustrate
              the consequences of matching and the appropriate handling of
              matched variables in cohort and case-control studies; 8) When
              explicitly accounting for temporal order in DAGs, it is necessary
              to use separate nodes for each timing; 9) In certain cases, DAGs
              with signed edges can be used in drawing conclusions about the
              direction of bias; and 10) DAGs can be (and should be) used to

               situations, however, it is possible to observe the same
               individual or unit of observation in the treatment and control
               states at different points in time. If the potential outcomes do
               not evolve in time for reasons other than the treatment, then
               the causal effect of a treatment can be estimated as the
               difference between an individual's observed outcome in the
               control state at time 1 and the same individual's observed
               outcome in the treatment state at time 2. The assumption that
               potential outcomes are stable in time (and thus age for
               individuals) is often heroic. If, however, potential outcomes

               extent to which managers are to blame when their firms become
               bankrupt. We study a sample of firms that file for Chapter 11
               and determine the actions taken by the firms' managers during
               the three-year period before the filing. We compare the sample
               with a control sample of firms that performed better. We suggest
               that the comparison provides evidence on the way managers act as
               their firms sink into financial trouble and whether financial
               distress is the result of incompetence or excessively
               self-serving managerial decisions or due to factors outside of
               management's control. We find that managers of the Chapter 11
               firms and the control firms make very similar decisions and
               that, on average, neither set of managers is perceived to be
               taking value-reducing actions. These results do not change when
               we control for managerial turnover or managerial ownership. We
               also find that when managers are replaced in firms that
               eventually file for Chapter 11 protection, the market does not
               respond positively, regardless of whether the new managers are
               from inside or outside the firm. Our findings suggest that when

               importance of risk-taking (from the perspective of authors and
               editors) to advance our field. SUMMARY Empirical research in
               financial economics relies too much on p-values, which are
               poorly understood in the first place. Journals want to publish
               papers with positive results and this incentivizes researchers
               to engage in data mining and ?p-hacking.? The outcome will
               likely be an embarrassing number of false positives?effects that
               will not be repeated in the future. The minimum Bayes factor
               (which is a function of the p-value) combined with prior odds
               provides a simple solution that can be reported alongside the
               usual p-value. The Bayesianized p-value answers the question:
               What is the probability that the null is true? The same
               technique can be used to answer: What threshold of t-statistic
               do I need so that there is only a 5\% chance that the null is
               true? The threshold depends on the economic plausibility of the
               hypothesis.",

  abstract  = "ABSTRACTP values linked to null hypothesis significance testing
               (NHST) is the most widely (mis)used method of statistical
               inference. Empirical data suggest that across the biomedical
               literature (1990?2015), when abstracts use P values 96\% of them
               have P values of 0.05 or less. The same percentage (96\%)
               applies for full-text articles. Among 100 articles in PubMed, 55
               report P values, while only 4 present confidence intervals for
               all the reported effect sizes, none use Bayesian methods and
               none use false-discovery rate. Over 25 years (1990?2015), use of
               P values in abstracts has doubled for all PubMed, and tripled
               for meta-analyses, while for some types of designs such as
               randomized trials the majority of abstracts report P values.
               There is major selective reporting for P values. Abstracts tend
               to highlight most favorable P values and inferences use even
               further spin to reach exaggerated, unreliable conclusions. The
               availability of large-scale data on P values from many papers
               has allowed the development and applications of methods that try
               to detect and model selection biases, for example, p-hacking,
               that cause patterns of excess significance. Inferences need to
               be cautious as they depend on the assumptions made by these
               models and can be affected by the presence of other biases
               (e.g., confounding in observational studies). While much of the
               unreliability of past and present research is driven by small,
               underpowered studies, NHST with P values may be also
               particularly problematic in the era of overpowered big data.
               NHST and P values are optimal only in a minority of current
               research. Using a more stringent threshold, as in the recently
               proposed shift from P < 0.05 to P < 0.005, is a temporizing
               measure to contain the flood and death-by-significance. NHST and
               P values may be replaced in many fields by other, more
               fit-for-purpose, inferential methods. However, curtailing
               selection biases requires additional measures, beyond changes in
               inferential methods, and in particular reproducible research
               practices.",

              the best of expectations over many application sectors across the
              field. For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire
              community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an
              inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by
              sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were
              not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and
              rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within
              the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely
              acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of
              AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the
              existing literature and contributions already done in the field
              of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached.
              For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define
              explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel
              definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior
              conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for
              which the explainability is sought. Departing from this
              definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent
              contributions related to the explainability of different Machine
              Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep
              Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built
              and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves
              as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by
              XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and
              explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of
              Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for
              the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real
              organizations with fairness, model explainability and
              accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide
              newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can
              serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research
              advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from
              other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity
              sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.",

               plots (PDPs) help visualize the average partial relationship
               between the predicted response and one or more features. In the
               presence of substantial interaction effects, the partial
               response relationship can be heterogeneous. Thus, an average
               curve, such as the PDP, can obfuscate the complexity of the

               graphing the functional relationship between the predicted
               response and the feature for individual observations.
               Specifically, ICE plots highlight the variation in the fitted

  abstract  = "Algorithmic systems that employ machine learning play an
               increasing role in making substantive decisions in modern
               society, ranging from online personalization to insurance and
               credit decisions to predictive policing. But their
               decision-making processes are often opaque-it is difficult to
               explain why a certain decision was made. We develop a formal
               foundation to improve the transparency of such decision-making
               systems. Specifically, we introduce a family of Quantitative
               Input Influence (QII) measures that capture the degree of
               influence of inputs on outputs of systems. These measures
               provide a foundation for the design of transparency reports that
               accompany system decisions (e.g., explaining a specific credit
               decision) and for testing tools useful for internal and external
               oversight (e.g., to detect algorithmic discrimination).
               Distinctively, our causal QII measures carefully account for
               correlated inputs while measuring influence. They support a
               general class of transparency queries and can, in particular,
               explain decisions about individuals (e.g., a loan decision) and
               groups (e.g., disparate impact based on gender). Finally, since
               single inputs may not always have high influence, the QII
               measures also quantify the joint influence of a set of inputs
               (e.g., age and income) on outcomes (e.g. loan decisions) and the
               marginal influence of individual inputs within such a set (e.g.,
               income). Since a single input may be part of multiple
               influential sets, the average marginal influence of the input is
               computed using principled aggregation measures, such as the
               Shapley value, previously applied to measure influence in
               voting. Further, since transparency reports could compromise
               privacy, we explore the transparency-privacy tradeoff and prove
               that a number of useful transparency reports can be made
               differentially private with very little addition of noise. Our
               empirical validation with standard machine learning algorithms
               demonstrates that QII measures are a useful transparency
               mechanism when black box access to the learning system is
               available. In particular, they provide better explanations than
               standard associative measures for a host of scenarios that we
               consider. Further, we show that in the situations we consider,
               QII is efficiently approximable and can be made differentially
               private while preserving accuracy.",

  abstract  = "Nowadays, Machine Learning (ML) models are becoming ubiquitous
               in today's society, supporting people with their day-to-day
               decisions. In this context, Explainable ML is a field of
               Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on making predictive
               models and their decisions interpretable by humans, enabling
               people to trust predictive models and to understand the
               underlying processes. A counterfactual is an effective type of
               Explainable ML technique that explains predictions by describing
               the changes needed in a sample to flip the outcome of the
               prediction. In this paper, we introduce counterfactual sets, an
               explanation approach that uses a set of counterfactuals to
               explain a prediction rather than a single counterfactual, by
               defining a sub-region of the feature space where the
               counterfactual holds. A method to extract counterfactual sets
               from a Random Forest (RF), the
               RandomForestOptimalCounterfactualSetExtractor(RF−OCSE), is
               presented. The method is based on a partial fusion of tree
               predictors from a RF into a single Decision Tree (DT) using a
               modification of the CART algorithm, and it obtains a
               counterfactual set that contains the optimal counterfactual. The
               proposal is validated through several experiments against
               existing alternatives on ten well-known datasets by comparing
               the percentage of valid counterfactuals, distance to the factual
               sample, and counterfactual sets quality.",

               management in banks has gained more prominence, and there has
               been a constant focus around how risks are being detected,

               and risk management and the current and emerging challenges.
               This paper, through a review of the available literature seeks
               to analyse and evaluate machine-learning techniques that have

               infer causal impact on the basis of a diffusion-regression
               state-space model that predicts the counterfactual market
               response in a synthetic control that would have occurred had no
               intervention taken place. In contrast to classical
               difference-in-differences schemes, state-space models make it
               possible to (i) infer the temporal evolution of attributable
               impact, (ii) incorporate empirical priors on the parameters in a
               fully Bayesian treatment, and (iii) flexibly accommodate

  abstract  = "Written by one of the preeminent researchers in the field, this
               book provides a comprehensive exposition of modern analysis of
               causation. It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous
               concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications
               in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics,
               philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social
               sciences. Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic,
               manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to
               causation and devises simple mathematical tools for studying the
               relationships between causal connections and statistical
               associations. The book will open the way for including causal
               analysis in the standard curricula of statistics, artificial
               intelligence, business, epidemiology, social sciences, and
               economics. Students in these fields will find natural models,
               simple inferential procedures, and precise mathematical
               definitions of causal concepts that traditional texts have
               evaded or made unduly complicated. The first edition of
               Causality has led to a paradigmatic change in the way that
               causality is treated in statistics, philosophy, computer
               science, social science, and economics. Cited in more than 5,000
               scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists
               from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this
               revised edition, Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers
               readers' questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent
               advances in this field of research. Causality will be of
               interests to students and professionals in a wide variety of
               fields. Anyone who wishes to elucidate meaningful relationships
               from data, predict effects of actions and policies, assess
               explanations of reported events, or form theories of causal
               understanding and causal speech will find this book stimulating

              been widely understood in practice. Using a simple
              pretest-posttest design in a linear setting, this paper
              translates the conventional algebraic formalization of FE and RE
              models into causal graphs and provides intuitively accessible
              graphical explanations about their data-generating and
              bias-removing processes. The proposed causal graphs highlight
              that FE and RE models consider different data-generating models.
              RE models presume a data-generating model that is identical to a
              randomized controlled trial, while FE models allow for unobserved
              time-invariant treatment-outcome confounding. Augmenting regular
              causal graphs that describe data-generating processes by adding
              the computational structures of FE and RE estimators, the paper
              visualizes how FE estimators (gain score and deviation score
              estimators) and RE estimators (quasi-deviation score estimators)
              offset unmeasured confounding bias. In contrast to standard
              regression or matching estimators that reduce confounding bias by
              blocking non-causal paths via conditioning, FE and RE estimators
              offset confounding bias by deliberately creating new non-causal
              paths and associations of opposite sign. Though FE and RE
              estimators are similar in their bias-offsetting mechanisms, the

              inference. Recognizing the problem, however, can be difficult in

              characterizing endogenous selection bias and of understanding its
              consequences (Hern{\'a}n et al. 2004). We use causal graphs
              (direct acyclic graphs, or DAGs) to highlight that endogenous
              selection bias stems from conditioning (e.g., controlling,
              stratifying, or selecting) on a so-called collider variable,
              i.e., a variable that is itself caused by two other variables,
              one that is (or is associated with) the treatment and another
              that is (or is associated with) the outcome. Endogenous selection
              bias can result from direct conditioning on the outcome variable,
              a post-outcome variable, a post-treatment variable, and even a
              pre-treatment variable. We highlight the difference between
              endogenous selection bias, common-cause confounding, and

               that eschewing theory places on inference In this rigorous and
               well-crafted work, Kenneth Wolpin examines the role of theory in
               inferential empirical work in economics and the social sciences
               in general---that is, any research that uses raw data to go
               beyond the mere statement of fact or the tabulation of
               statistics. He considers in particular the limits that eschewing
               the use of theory places on inference.Wolpin finds that the
               absence of theory in inferential work that addresses
               microeconomic issues is pervasive. That theory is unnecessary
               for inference is exemplified by the expression ``let the data
               speak for themselves.'' This approach is often called ``reduced
               form.'' A more nuanced view is based on the use of experiments
               or quasi-experiments to draw inferences. Atheoretical approaches
               stand in contrast to what is known as the structuralist
               approach, which requires that a researcher specify an explicit
               model of economic behavior---that is, a theory. Wolpin offers a
               rigorous examination of both structuralist and nonstructuralist
               approaches. He first considers ex ante policy evaluation,
               highlighting the role of theory in the implementation of
               parametric and nonparametric estimation strategies. He
               illustrates these strategies with two examples, a wage tax and a
               school attendance subsidy, and summarizes the results from
               applications. He then presents a number of examples that
               illustrate the limits of inference without theory: the effect of
               unemployment benefits on unemployment duration; the effect of
               public welfare on women's labor market and demographic outcomes;
               the effect of school attainment on earnings; and a famous field
               experiment in education dealing with class size. Placing each
               example within the context of the broader literature, he
               contrasts them to recent work that relies on theory for
               inference.",

               models as their default methods for causal inference with
               longitudinal data. We show that the ability of these models to
               adjust for unobserved time-invariant confounders comes at the
               expense of dynamic causal relationships, which are permitted
               under an alternative selection-on-observables approach. Using
               the nonparametric directed acyclic graph, we highlight two key
               causal identification assumptions of unit fixed effects models:
               Past treatments do not directly influence current outcome, and
               past outcomes do not affect current treatment. Furthermore, we
               introduce a new nonparametric matching framework that elucidates
               how various unit fixed effects models implicitly compare treated
               and control observations to draw causal inference. By
               establishing the equivalence between matching and weighted unit
               fixed effects estimators, this framework enables a diverse set

                   estimating the effects of many-valued treatments (like

                   many groups, and prediction models with many regressors. In
                   these settings, machine learning methods that combine
                   regularized estimation and data-driven choices of
                   regularization parameters are useful to avoid over-fitting.
                   In this article, we analyze the performance of a class of
                   machine learning estimators that includes ridge, lasso and
                   pretest in contexts that require simultaneous estimation of

               began around the mid-1980s in Japan has been called the 20th
               century's biggest bubble. In its aftermath, the country faced a

               property (including housing) and financial markets was a
               problem. In 2009, the IMF proposed the creation of a housing
               price index to the G20 in order to fill this information gap,
               and the proposal was adopted. Furthermore, in 2011, it was

              predictors, such as factors derived from a large macroeconomic

              To accommodate for multiple predictors and nonlinearities, we
              take a machine learning approach of random forests. Our results

                   survey inference being a special case. We propose a
                   regularized prediction approach that predicts the outcomes

                   variables such that the ignorability assumption is
                   reasonable while the Bayesian framework is straightforward
                   for quantification of uncertainty. Besides the auxiliary
                   variables, inspired by Little \& An (2004), we also extend
                   the approach by estimating the propensity score for a unit

                   proponents of a philosophy to point out these problems. Here
                   are a few holes in Bayesian data analysis: (1) the usual
                   rules of conditional probability fail in the quantum realm,
                   (2) flat or weak priors lead to terrible inferences about
                   things we care about, (3) subjective priors are incoherent,
                   (4) Bayesian decision picks the wrong model, (5) Bayes
                   factors fail in the presence of flat or weak priors, (6) for
                   Cantorian reasons we need to check our models, but this
                   destroys the coherence of Bayesian inference. Some of the
                   problems of Bayesian statistics arise from people trying to
                   do things they shouldn't be trying to do, but other holes
                   are not so easily patched. In particular, it may be a good
                   idea to avoid flat, weak, or conventional priors, but such
                   advice, if followed, would go against the vast majority of
                   Bayesian practice and requires us to confront the
                   fundamental incoherence of Bayesian inference. This does not
                   mean that we think Bayesian inference is a bad idea, but it
                   does mean that there is a tension between Bayesian logic and
                   Bayesian workflow which we believe can only be resolved by
                   considering Bayesian logic as a tool, a way of revealing
                   inevitable misfits and incoherences in our model

                   of the evaluation is a change of basis from coefficient
                   space to the space of singular vectors of the matrix of
                   predictors. After this change of basis and an analytical
                   integration, we reduce the problem of finding moments of a
                   density over k + m dimensions, to finding moments of an
                   m-dimensional density, where k is the number of coefficients

              to target their audiences' limited attention. We develop an
              economically motivated high dimensional selection model that
              improves learning from text (and from sparse counts data more

              frequently to repeat it. It allows for parallel estimation,
              making it computationally scalable. A first application revisits
              the partisanship of US congressional speech. We find that earlier
              spikes in partisanship manifested in increased repetition of
              different phrases, whereas the upward trend starting in the 1990s
              is due to entirely distinct phrase selection. Additional
              applications show how our model can backcast, nowcast, and
              forecast macroeconomic indicators using newspaper text, and that

              ETFs in our sample, the magnitude of their price response does
              not seem directly related to the size of the reduction in either
              credit risk or liquidity risk, but rather appears to reflect
              mostly the eligibility of the ETF and its underlying bonds at the

  abstract  = "AbstractWith the increasing use of complex quantitative models
               in applications throughout the financial world, model risk has
               become a major concern. Such risk is generated by the potential
               inaccuracy and inappropriate use of models in business
               applications, which can lead to substantial financial losses and
               reputational damage. In this paper, we deal with the management
               and measurement of model risk. First, a model risk framework is
               developed, adapting concepts such as risk appetite, monitoring,
               and mitigation to the particular case of model risk. The
               usefulness of such a framework for preventing losses associated
               with model risk is demonstrated through case studies. Second, we
               investigate the ways in which different ways of using and
               perceiving models within an organisation both lead to different
               model risks. We identify four distinct model cultures and argue
               that in conditions of deep model uncertainty, each of those
               cultures makes a valuable contribution to model risk governance.
               Thus, the space of legitimate challenges to models is expanded,
               such that, in addition to a technical critique, operational and
               commercial concerns are also addressed. Third, we discuss
               through the examples of proxy modelling, longevity risk, and
               investment advice, common methods and challenges for quantifying
               model risk. Difficulties arise in mapping model errors to actual
               financial impact. In the case of irreducible model uncertainty,
               it is necessary to employ a variety of measurement approaches,
               based on statistical inference, fitting multiple models, and
               stress and scenario analysis.",

              be able to make well-informed financial decisions. Yet new
              international research demonstrates that financial illiteracy is
              widespread when financial markets are well developed as in
              Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Japan, Italy, New Zealand, and
              the United States, or when they are changing rapidly as in
              Russia. Further, across these countries, we show that the older
              population believes itself well informed, even though it is
              actually less well informed than average. Other common patterns
              are also evident: women are less financially literate than men
              and are aware of this shortfall. More educated people are more
              informed, yet education is far from a perfect proxy for literacy.
              There are also ethnic/racial and regional differences:
              city-dwellers in Russia are better informed than their rural
              counterparts, while in the U.S., African Americans and Hispanics
              are relatively less financially literate than others. Moreover,
              the more financially knowledgeable are also those most likely to
              plan for retirement. In fact, answering one additional financial
              question correctly is associated with a 3-4 percentage point
              higher chance of planning for retirement in countries as diverse
              as Germany, the U.S., Japan, and Sweden; in the Netherlands, it
              boosts planning by 10 percentage points. Finally, using
              instrumental variables, we show that these estimates probably
              underestimate the effects of financial literacy on retirement
              planning. In sum, around the world, financial literacy is

               antidote to the increasing complexity of consumers' financial
               decisions over the last generation. We conduct a meta-analysis
               of the relationship of financial literacy and of financial
               education to financial behaviors in 168 papers covering 201
               prior studies. We find that interventions to improve financial
               literacy explain only 0.1\% of the variance in financial
               behaviors studied, with weaker effects in low-income samples.
               Like other education, financial education decays over time; even
               large interventions with many hours of instruction have
               negligible effects on behavior 20 months or more from the time
               of intervention. Correlational studies that measure financial
               literacy find stronger associations with financial behaviors. We
               conduct three empirical studies, and we find that the partial
               effects of financial literacy diminish dramatically when one
               controls for psychological traits that have been omitted in
               prior research or when one uses an instrument for financial
               literacy to control for omitted variables. Financial education
               as studied to date has serious limitations that have been masked

               narrower role for ?just-in-time? financial education tied to

              evidence of the abatement cost of green-house gases across
              countries remains scant. In this study we estimate the average
              yearly green-house gas abatement costs per capita for a panel of
              28 OECD countries in years 1990--2015. The marginal abatement
              costs are estimated using a novel data-driven approach based on
              convex quantile regression. Compared to traditional frontier
              estimation methods, the quantile approach takes into account a
              broader set of abatement options and is more robust to
              inefficiency, noise, and heteroscedasticity in empirical data.
              The comparison of OECD countries shows that the actual abatement
              cost per capita has been very modest, much lower than predicted
              in the late 1990s. This result has profound policy implications,

               provides a unified treatment of two methods used in contemporary
               econometric research, cross section and data panel methods. By
               focusing on assumptions that can be given behavioral content,
               the book maintains an appropriate level of rigor while
               emphasizing intuitive thinking. The analysis covers both linear
               and nonlinear models, including models with dynamics and/or
               individual heterogeneity. In addition to general estimation
               frameworks (particular methods of moments and maximum
               likelihood), specific linear and nonlinear methods are covered
               in detail, including probit and logit models and their
               multivariate, Tobit models, models for count data, censored and
               missing data schemes, causal (or treatment) effects, and

               separated into population and sampling assumptions. This second
               edition has been substantially updated and revised. Improvements
               include a broader class of models for missing data problems;
               more detailed treatment of cluster problems, an important topic
               for empirical researchers; expanded discussion of ``generalized

               profitability, stability and cost efficiency). The effect of
               migration differs depending on the target business model. When

              forecasting of football match results in national league

              the predictive observation mass function for a high-dimensional
              panel of weekly match results. Our main interest is in
              forecasting whether the match result is a win, a loss or a draw
              for each team. The dynamic model for delivering such forecasts
              can be based on three different dependent variables: the pairwise
              count of the number of goals, the difference between the numbers
              of goals, or the category of the match result (win, loss, draw).
              The different dependent variables require different
              distributional assumptions. Furthermore, different dynamic model
              specifications can be considered for generating the forecasts. We
              investigate empirically which dependent variable and which
              dynamic model specification yield the best forecasting results.
              We validate the precision of the resulting forecasts and the
              success of the forecasts in a betting simulation in an extensive
              forecasting study for match results from six large European

               framework is critical. Legal standards need to be enacted and
               insurers should be encouraged and given incentives to adopt a
               human-centred approach in the design and use of big data

               used should be empowered through their active involvement in

               outputs. More importantly, current black-box AI implementations
               are subject to bias and adversarial attacks that may poison the
               learning or the inference processes. Explainable AI (XAI) is a
               new trend of AI algorithms that provide explanations of their AI
               decisions. In this paper, we propose a framework for achieving a
               more trustworthy and XAI by leveraging features of blockchain,
               smart contracts, trusted oracles, and decentralized storage. We
               specify a framework for complex AI systems in which the decision
               outcomes are reached based on decentralized consensuses of
               multiple AI and XAI predictors. The paper discusses how our
               proposed framework can be utilized in key application areas with
               practical use cases. This article is categorized under:

  abstract  = "Abstract Explainability in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been
               revived as a topic of active research by the need of conveying
               safety and trust to users in the ?how? and ?why? of automated
               decision-making in different applications such as autonomous
               driving, medical diagnosis, or banking and finance. While
               explainability in AI has recently received significant
               attention, the origins of this line of work go back several
               decades to when AI systems were mainly developed as
               (knowledge-based) expert systems. Since then, the definition,
               understanding, and implementation of explainability have been
               picked up in several lines of research work, namely, expert
               systems, machine learning, recommender systems, and in
               approaches to neural-symbolic learning and reasoning, mostly
               happening during different periods of AI history. In this
               article, we present a historical perspective of Explainable
               Artificial Intelligence. We discuss how explainability was
               mainly conceived in the past, how it is understood in the
               present and, how it might be understood in the future. We
               conclude the article by proposing criteria for explanations that
               we believe will play a crucial role in the development of

               Association Football teams solely on the basis of the relative
               discrepancies in scores through relevant match instances. The
               pi-rating system is applicable to any other sport where the

               as well as determining the relative performances between

               capture a team's performance, we have a) assessed them against
               two recently proposed football ELO rating variants and b) used
               them as the basis of a football betting strategy against
               published market odds. The results show that the pi-ratings

              inference and rule-based reasoning, together with an in-game
              time-series approach. The framework is novel in three ways. The
              framework consists of two major components: a rule-based reasoner
              and a Bayesian network component. The two different approaches
              cooperate in predicting the results of sports matches. It is
              motivated by the observation that sports matches are highly
              stochastic, but at the same time, the strategies of a team can be
              approximated by crisp logic rules. Furthermore, because of the
              rule-based component, our framework can give reasonably good
              predictions even when statistical data is scanty: it can be used
              to predict results of matches between teams which have had few
              previous encounters. Machine learning techniques have great
              difficulty in handling such situations of insufficient data.
              Second, our framework is able to consider many factors, such as
              current scores, morale, fatigue, skills, etc. when it predicts
              the results of sports matches: most previous work considered only
              one factor, usually the score. Third, in contrast to most
              previous work on sports results prediction, we use a
              knowledge-based in-game time-series approach to predict sports
              matches. This approach enables our framework to reflect the
              tides/flows of a sports match, making our predictions certainly
              more realistic, and somewhat more accurate. We have implemented a
              football results predictor called FRES (Football Result Expert
              System) based on this framework, and show that it gives
              reasonable and stable predictions.",

              round-robin, pure knockout and hybrids of these designs. We show,

               stock market by using 10 sectoral indices for the period from
               2010-2019. We use the novel Ready's (2018) oil shock
               decomposition mechanism. Using the rolling regression and
               dynamic conditional correlation, we ascertain the time varying
               properties of different oil shocks on the sectoral returns. To
               understand the asymmetric effect, we employ the markov switching
               regression. The results of the study are presented in two sets:
               One, we observe a structural dynamic shift in the conditional
               correlation between the oil shocks and sectoral returns across
               the study period. Also, the markov regime regression confirms
               that demand shocks have positive effect on all sectors in high
               and low volatility regime signalling the huge consumption demand
               in Indian industries. The supply shocks are not significant
               either in low or high volatility regimes indicating collapse of
               economic activities in such case. the demand and supply shocks

              making process, focusing on systems where we are uncertain about
              the outcomes but can quantify how probable they are using random
              variables. Any decision one makes in such a situation leads to a
              distribution of outcomes and requires a way to evaluate a
              decision. The standard approach is to marginalise the
              distribution of outcomes into a single number that tries in some
              way to summarise the value of each decision. After selecting a
              marginalisation approach, mathematicians and decision makers
              focus their analysis on the marginalised value but ignore the
              distribution. We argue that we should also be investigating the
              implications of the chosen mathematical approach for the whole
              distribution of outcomes. We illustrate the effect different
              mathematical formulations have on the distribution with one-stage
              and sequential decision problems. We show that different ways to
              marginalise the distributions can result in very similar
              decisions but each way has a different complexity and
              computational cost. It is often computationally intractable to
              approximate optimal decisions to high precision and much research
              goes into developing algorithms that are suboptimal in the
              marginalised sense, but work within the computational budget
              available. If the performance of these algorithms is evaluated
              they are mainly judged based on the marginalised values, however,
              comparing the performance using the full distribution provides
              interesting information: We provide numerical examples from
              dynamic pricing applications where the suboptimal algorithm
              results in higher profit than the optimal algorithm in more than
              half of the realisations, which is paid for with a more
              significant underperformance in the remaining realisations. All
              the problems discussed in this thesis lead to continuous
              optimisation problems. We develop a new algorithm that can be
              used on top of existing optimisation algorithms to reduce the
              cost of approximating solutions. The algorithm is tested on a
              range of optimisation problems and is shown to be competitive

              analysis more difficult, especially as data become increasingly
              complex and statistical methods become increasingly
              sophisticated. R Markdown is a new technology that makes creating
              fully-reproducible statistical analysis simple and painless. It
              provides a solution suitable not only for cutting edge research,
              but also for use in an introductory statistics course. We present
              evidence that R Markdown can be used effectively in introductory
              statistics courses, and discuss its role in the rapidly-changing
              world of statistical computation.",

              techniques that were developed before computing became
              inexpensive and ubiquitous. Now that computing is readily
              available to all students, instructors can change the way we
              teach statistical concepts. This article describes computational
              ideas that can support teaching George Cobb's Three Rs of

              Results in the Eagle Ford Shale of South Texas",
  author   = "Lee, Se Yoon and Mallick, Bani K",
  abstract = "Recently, the petroleum industry has faced the era of data
              explosion, and many oil and gas companies resort to data-driven
              approaches for unconventional field development planning. The
              objective of this paper is to analyze shale oil wells in a shale
              reservoir and develop a statistical model useful for upstream.
              Shale oil wells dataset comprises three aspects of information:
              oil production rate time series data; well completion data; and
              well location data. However, traditional decline curve analysis
              only utilizes the temporal trajectory of the production rates.
              Motivated by this, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model that
              exploits the full aspects of the shale oil wells data. The
              proposed model provides the following three functionalities:
              first, estimations of a production decline curve at an individual
              well and entire reservoir levels; second, identification of
              significant completion predictors explaining a well productivity;
              and third, spatial predictions for the oil production rate
              trajectory of a new well provided completion predictors. As a
              fully Bayesian approach has been adopted, the functionalities are
              endowed with uncertainty quantification which is a crucial task
              in investigating unconventional reservoirs. The data for this
              study come from 360 shale oil wells completed in the Eagle Ford
              Shale of South Texas.",

  title     = "Robust Bayesian inference for set‐identified models",
  author    = "Giacomini, Raffaella and Kitagawa, Toru",
  abstract  = "This paper reconciles the asymptotic disagreement between
               Bayesian and frequentist inference in set‐identified models by
               adopting a multiple‐prior (robust) Bayesian approach. We propose
               new tools for Bayesian inference in set‐identified models and
               show that they have a well‐defined posterior interpretation in
               finite samples and are asymptotically valid from the frequentist
               perspective. The main idea is to construct a prior class that
               removes the source of the disagreement: the need to specify an
               unrevisable prior for the structural parameter given the
               reduced‐form parameter. The corresponding class of posteriors
               can be summarized by reporting the `posterior lower and upper
               probabilities' of a given event and/or the `set of posterior
               means' and the associated `robust credible region'. We show that
               the set of posterior means is a consistent estimator of the true
               identified set and the robust credible region has the correct
               frequentist asymptotic coverage for the true identified set if
               it is convex. Otherwise, the method provides posterior inference
               about the convex hull of the identified set. For
               impulse‐response analysis in set‐identified Structural Vector
               Autoregressions, the new tools can be used to overcome or
               quantify the sensitivity of standard Bayesian inference to the
               choice of an unrevisable prior.",
